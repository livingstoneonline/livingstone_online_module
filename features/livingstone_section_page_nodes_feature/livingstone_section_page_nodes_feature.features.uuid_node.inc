<p>The <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> has focused on the following manuscripts: the "Retrospect to be Inserted in the Journal" (10 Mar. 1870), the 1870 Field Diary (17 Aug. 1870-22 Mar. 1871), the 1871 Field Diary (23 Mar.-3 Nov. 1871), and a selection of six 1871 letters (5 Feb.-26 June 1871). Livingstone\'s practices in composing these texts resulted in a series of manuscripts that today make normalized citation difficult, particularly with the addition of multiple spectral images for each manuscript side.</p>

<p>To assist our users, we outline below the standardized system that we have adopted for, first, citing specific manuscript pages and spectral images and, second, naming spectral image files. In the appendices that follow, we provide all necessary supporting information, including overviews of each manuscript; author and date details, page numbers, and project file names for each page of each manuscript; and all processed spectral image names.</p>

<p><strong><u>Bonus</u>: </strong>Download a <a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/manuscript-citation-and-file-naming-practices/1870-Diary-Layout.zip">spreadsheet</a> that sets out the relationship of Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts to their underlying source texts in detail.</p>

<p class="space2">We use a standardized citation system when referencing Livingstone’s manuscripts and our spectral images. The system draws on the information set out in the appendices (below). It is shaped by our two different citation practices: we use abbreviated details when citing in our critical essays and other paratextual materials, but include more expansive information when naming corresponding spectral image files.<a id="link3" name="link3"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>Citing manuscripts and spectral images</strong>. We combine the <a href="#link12">author and date details</a> with the <a href="#link12">Livingstone page number</a> to cite any given manuscript page, as in the following examples:</p>

<p>Livingstone 1870a:[4]<br />
Livingstone 1870d:{19}<br />
Livingstone 1871f:CII</p>

<p>We use the natural light images (color) by default for all items and so do not call out these images individually. Otherwise, we add the <a href="#link13">spectral image short name</a> to the regular citation when referencing processed spectral images, as in the following examples:</p>

<p>Livingstone 1870i:XXXII IC1<br />
Livingstone 1871f:CLXIII ratio<br />
Livingstone 1871i:[1] pseudo_v4_BY</p>

<p class="space2"><em>Note:</em> We draw on the relevant entries in our <a href="/spectral-imaging/integrated-project-bibliography">bibliography</a> and, simply, shortened versions of the image numbers used in our <a href="/islandora/search">digital catalogue</a> but in square brackets (e.g., "0004" becomes "[4]," "0691" becomes "[691]," etc.) when citing the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) and the field diaries from Livingstone\'s last expedition (1866-73).<a id="link4" name="link4"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>Naming spectral image files</strong>. We combine the <a href="#link12">project file name</a> with the <a href="#link13">spectral image long name</a> to create the names for the spectral images of each manuscript leaf, as in the following examples:</p>

<p><em>Citation</em>: Livingstone 1870e:XI IC5<br />
<em>Corresponding image</em>: liv_000202_0002_IC5_(liv_000204_0001_trans)</p>

<p class="space2">As noted above, the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> encompasses an assortment of manuscripts from the 1870-71 period. We provide detailed entries for each of the texts in our<strong> </strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/integrated-project-bibliography">bibliography</a>. Below we reference those entries using only author and date details.<a id="link7" name="link7"></a></p>

<p class="space2"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>"Retrospect to be Inserted in the Journal" (10 Mar. 1870)</strong>. The "Retrospect to be Inserted in the Journal" consists of a single manuscript: Livingstone 1870a. The manuscript contains a total of eight pages (two per side of leaf).<a id="link8a" name="link8a"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>1870 Field Diary (17 Aug. 1870-22 Mar. 1871)</strong>. The 1870 Field Diary consists of a series of pages written over diverse undertexts. The pages may be divided by undertexts into gatherings and sub-gatherings (as in our six-part<strong> </strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">State of the Manuscript</a> essay) or by a combination of undertexts and dates into fragments (as in our <a href="/spectral-imaging/integrated-project-bibliography">bibliography</a> and here): Livingstone 1870b, 1870c, 1870d, 1870e, 1870f, 1870g, 1870h, 1870i, 1870j, 1870k, 1871a, 1871b, and 1871e.</p>

<p>The first fragment (Livingstone 1870b) consists of 35 leaves, each of which contains a page on the recto and verso, for a total of 70 pages. The remaining fragments together consist of 41 leaves that contain a total of 96 pages plus a printed map that we have not numbered.</p>

<p class="space2">There are also two sequences of pages (1870d, 1870g) taken from a <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A&quot;1870&quot;&amp;f[]=creator_ms%3A&quot;Livingstone%2C+Agnes+3%2C+1847-1912&quot;&amp;f[]=repository_ms%3A&quot;Bodleian+Library.+Weston+Library&quot;&amp;f[]=genre_ms%3A&quot;autographs+(manuscripts)&quot;">transcription</a> of the entire 1870 Field Diary manuscript made by Agnes Livingstone. These pages cover dates missing from the original manuscript pages and may indeed be transcriptions of lost original pages, although the evidence is inconclusive. We have treated these fragments as if they did form part of the original manuscript and include them in the relevant places below.<a id="link8b" name="link8b"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>1871 Field Diary (23 Mar.-3 Nov. 1871)</strong>. The 1871 Field Diary consists of two parts: the main Nyangwe segment (Livingstone 1871f) written across the pages of a single, eight-page issue of <em>The Standard</em> (London) and a fragmentary set of additional diary pages (Livingstone 1871k, 1871l, 1871m) written over various scraps of paper.</p>

<p>In creating the Nyangwe segment (1871f), Livingstone cut up the issue of <em>The Standard</em> into 16 smaller leaves, then assembled these into two 32-page "copy-books" (Waller, in Livingstone 1874,2:114n.). In other words, Livingstone composed two diary pages on each side of each leaf for a total of 64 pages. (Note: Livingstone or someone after him further cut one of the original diary leaves into two halves, with the result that there are today 34 folia and so 34 spectral image sets for this segment of the diary, rather than 32 as would be expected).</p>

<p class="space2">The fragmentary set of additional diary pages consists of three separate items. The first item (1871k) consists of two leaves with two pages on each side for a total of eight pages. The second item (1870k) is a single-leaf fragment. One side has two diary pages, the other just one, for a total of three pages. The last time (1870m) includes two leaves with one page per side for a total of four leaves.<a id="link9" name="link9"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>1871 Letters (5 Feb.-26 June 1871)</strong>. The 1871 letters include six separate letters: 1871c, 1871d, 1871g, 1871h, 1871i, and 1871j. The first letter (1871c) consists of two leaves, each of which contains one page per side for a total of four pages. The next three letters (1871d, 1871g, 1871h) consist of one leaf each, each of which has one page per side. The last two letters each occupy one side of the same single leaf.</p>

The leaves are taken from a proof copy of <em>The Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</em>, 14.1 (8 Nov. 1869): 1-18. This issue is devoted almost wholly to letters from Livingstone written in July 1868. This proof copy, like the 24 November 1869 issue of <em>The Standard</em>, was delivered to Livingstone on 4 February 1871 along with three letters from Waller (see <a href="http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-annotations">The Letter with Annotations, note for 0001.2-3</a>). One of the letters from Waller (1869b), in fact, discusses the particular RGS meeting to which the <em>Proceedings</em> correspond.</p>

This segment shows, upside-down, the printed conclusion of Livingstone’s "despatch" to the Earl of Clarendon (July 1868), and, handwritten, Livingstone’s reference to that same despatch on the last line on the page: "Despatch supplementary to that from Bangwe[olo]."</span></p>

<p>The published version of the <em>Proceedings</em> opens with an address by Roderick Murchison, President of the RGS, then includes letters from Livingstone to John Kirk (8 July 1868), the Earl of Clarendon (July 1868), Roderick Murchison (8 July 1868), and Sir Bartle Frere (July 1868). Livingstone composed all these letters near Lake Bangweolo. There follows a letter from John Kirk to C. Gonne, Secretary to the Government of Bombay (7 Sept. 1869). Finally, the issue concludes with a summary of the audience discussion that followed the reading of the letters. This summary notes that the audience included Bartle Frere, A.G. Findlay, Francis Galton, and Horace Waller.</p>

<p>Although comparison of the proof copy and published text shows that the two are not identical, there is enough overlap to determine that the verso of the first leaf of Livingstone’s letter ([2]), which is numbered page 9, contains portions of pages 12 (the conclusion of Livingstone’s letter to the Earl of Clarendon), 16 (Kirk’s letter to Gonne), and 17 (the opening of the audience discussion) of the published text. In other words, this leaf is taken from the end of the issue, and would have been among the first Livingstone used were he to turn over the issue and begin writing on successive leaves, end to beginning. More curiously, on [2], Livingstone himself refers to the letter to the Earl of Clarendon (July 1868), or what Livingstone calls the "despatch … from Bangweolo," and does so directly below where the printed fragment of the letter appears on the page.</p>

The segment shows that the "uncorrected" proof copy of the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</em> was specifically marked "for Dr Livingstone Interior of Africa."</span></p>

<p>The verso of the second leaf of Livingstone’s letter ([4]) corresponds to pages 1 and 2 (prefatory matter and opening of the address by Murchison) of the published version, and is in fact numbered page 1. This suggests that this leaf would have been the last that Livingstone used if writing on successive leaves, end to beginning, of the <em>Proceedings</em> proof copy. The handwritten address to Livingstone in the top left-hand corner of the page, "Dr Livingstone Interior of Africa," confirms that this was indeed the first page of the proof copy (the published version of the text has additional prefatory matter, pages i-vii, not found in the proof copy).</p>

<p>Three other Livingstone letters written on leaves of the <em>Proceedings</em> proof copy have survived. These are held at the National Library of Scotland. One is addressed to Agnes Livingstone and dated March 1871. The other two are to John Kirk and dated 13 February 1871 and 25 March 1871. These letters are on pages 2, 4, and 5, respectively, of the <em>Proceedings</em> proof copy. The letters have been <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">spectrally imaged and&nbsp;published</a> by the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project. Given the dates and pages numbers of these letters, it is possible that Livingstone wrote the two leaves of the letter to Waller on different dates – the first on 5 February 1871 and the second sometime later, possibly on or after 25 March 1871 (although other evidence suggests a date no later than 16 February 1871, see <a href="http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-annotations">The Letter with Annotations, note for 0001.1</a>).</p>

<p>Alternately, although Livingstone may have started writing on the first leaf of the letter on 5 February 1871, he may have continued adding to this leaf and eventually begun writing on the second leaf sometime after 5 February 1871. Internal details certainly supports this conclusion. For instance, the narrative style of the two leaves of the letter differs considerably and suggests that Livingstone wrote these while in two very different moods – the narrative on the first leaf ([1] and [2]) jumps rapidly from topic to topic, while that of the second ([3] and [4]) contains several long meditations on East African slavery. Livingstone’s "overtext" on the first leaf ([2]), i.e., the portion of the letter written over the printed text of the <em>Proceedings</em>, is clearly an after-the-fact addition, while the "overtext" on the second leaf ([4]) and part of the vertical text in the right margin likewise appear to be after-the-fact additions.</p>

The segment presents Livingstone’s signature followed by a red seal. The processed image additionally highlights the proximity of the seal to one of the folds of the page.</span></p>

<p>Finally, each leaf of the letter is to some extent a self-contained entity, and the narrative of the letter does not continue from [2] to [3]. Rather, each leaf has an opening, closing, and postscript in the form of the "overtext." For instance, the recto of the first leaf ([1]) is dated 5 February 1871, addressed "My Dear Waller," and covered with text that runs horizontally across the page from top to bottom. The verso of the first leaf ([2]) contains the printed text of the <em>Proceedings</em> upside down. The layout of Livingstone’s text on the verso shows that he continued his text from the recto, and wrote around the printed text in the top, left, and bottom margins successively. He then turned the leaf ninety degrees clockwise and wrote in the remaining margin (where he also placed his signature). Finally, without again turning the letter, he wrote across the printed text of the <em>Proceedings</em>, perpendicular to that text.</p>

<p>The recto of the second leaf ([3]) begins simply with "P.S. to Waller," then follows the same composition format – recto and verso, recto to verso – as the first leaf ([1] and [2]). Livingstone’s signature also appears in roughly the same place as on the first leaf ([1]), but is here followed by a red seal. This seal may have been used to hold together the flaps of the letter after the pages had been folded and the letter was ready to be transported. As a result, although this leaf is clearly a postscript, it is still addressed to Waller in the opening (though, of course, adding Waller’s name here was necessary to ensure the two parts of the letter remained together), has a concluding signature ([4]) and its own postscripts ([4]), just like the first leaf. The emergence of more evidence may clarify the composition history of the letter further.</p>

<p>David Livingstone is one of the most written about figures of the nineteenth century. From the 1870s until at least the 1950s, hundreds of books were published that celebrated his life and work in Africa. In light of the sheer volume of attention that Livingstone has attracted, it has become increasingly important not just to study the man, but to study his mythology. No longer is it only Livingstone’s life that is of interest, but rather what has been called his cultural “after-life” (MacKenzie 1996).</p>

<p>This essay investigates Livingstone’s memorialization in print, offering what we might call a brief “metabiography” (Rupke 2008). The purpose of metabiography – or a biography of biographies – is to interrogate the ways in which the historical reputation of a biographical subject is not static but rather can show considerable malleability. Instead of trying to offer the final word about an individual’s “real” identity, it aims to explore “the ideological embeddedness of biographical portraits” (Rupke 2008:215). The aim is thus to offer a broad overview of the ways in which Livingstone has been written and re-written, imagined and re-imagined, across a considerable historical period for a range of socio-political purposes.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Imperial Scramble: The Partition of Africa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Until well into the twentieth century, many of the numerous Livingstone biographies were bound up with the contemporary concerns of the British Empire. That the imperial horizons should manifest themselves in such works is perhaps to be expected, given the considerable impact that Livingstone himself made on British intervention in east and central Africa. Certainly, it is well known that Livingstone’s call for the introduction of Christianity, commerce and civilisation to combat the slave trade proved to be an inspiration for a range of missionary endeavours in Africa.</p>

<p>But what’s of interest here is less the broad influence that Livingstone had, than the specific ways in which various writers put him to use. What emerges in an examination of the numerous biographies is that many of them took Livingstone as their subject in order to explicitly engage with their contemporary imperial moment. As the face of imperialism changed so too did Livingstone’s image: political developments in empire tended to result in the remobilisation and reconstruction of the iconic Livingstone, in accordance with the needs of the immediate context. As John MacKenzie puts it, the Livingstone myth “accommodated itself, or was manifested to fit, the particular requirements of the age” (MacKenzie 1990:33).</p>

<p>In the aftermath of his death, Livingstone’s name acquired particular significance in connection with Nyasaland, where the Church of Scotland and Free Church established mission stations. It is well known that his association with the region, and with the missionary settlements at Livingstonia and Blantyre, formed part of the justification for the establishment of the British Central Africa Protectorate. In the earliest phase of the biographies, then, it became common to authorize such colonial developments using the symbolic weight of Livingstone’s name.</p>

<p>The first Commissioner of British Central Africa, Sir Harry H. Johnston, did just that in his biography of 1891. For Johnston, Livingstone not only provided the mandate for the protectorate, but was a predecessor to his own political administration in the region: “In Zambezia and Nyasaland especially,” he wrote, “– in what will soon be called ‘British Central Africa’ – Livingstone’s work is rapidly nearing the fruition he longed for under the flag he loved” (Johnston 1891: 367).</p>

<p>This effort to legitimate the Protectorate in this way can be traced in a number of British-published works towards the end of the nineteenth century. It is an argument of this variety, for instance, that we encounter in the abolitionist Horace Waller’s pamphlet of 1887, <em>The Title-Deeds to Nyassa-Land</em> (Helly 1987:325). But other imperial concerns likewise arise in contemporaneous biographies. This is evident in a classic text by Thomas Hughes, an author better known for writing <em>Tom Brown’s Schooldays</em> (1857).</p>

<p>While Hughes was certainly attracted to Livingstone’s muscular Christianity (the ethic of bodily and moral masculinity that Livingstone thought should characterize empire’s servants), a major motivation behind his biography was contemporary colonial competition with Germany. Concerned by the rise of the German East African protectorate, which was “[u]tterly unused” to the work of colonial administration and had “no sympathy for the natives,” he urged his readers to hold fast to “Livingstone’s principles and methods.” The future of east Africa was imperilled and so it was vital, he felt, to remember Britain’s duty in the region “which in God’s providence we have to bear” (Hughes 1889:206).</p>

<p>From this small sampling, we can detect something of the way in which late nineteenth-century Livingstone biographies were embedded in the contemporary politics of the scramble for Africa. Livingstone was mapped onto particular British colonial concerns while, in a more general sense, being interpreted as a forerunner of partition who ushered in a new era for Africa. While he continued to be used to galvanise intervention and defend British interests, however, the way in which Livingstone was represented began to adapt with the dawn of the twentieth century and the accompanying changes in empire.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Edwardian Empire</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>In the Edwardian period, a mood of imperial anxiety was emerging. A poor performance in the Boer war and increasing competition from international rivals, such as Germany and the United States, presented challenges to British self-confidence. In this context, biographies often recited the achievements and colonial developments since Livingstone’s time in Africa – undoubtedly comforting at a time of unease. They served to encourage their readers that the British Empire was not stagnating.</p>

<p>The new mood, however, articulated itself most clearly on the issue of imperial masculinity (Dawson 1994:148). Concerns about the physical decline of British troops, mounting challenges to established social norms, and developing fears about social degeneration, coalesced into a general anxiety about the malaise of British manhood.</p>

<p>Of course, as a representative of muscular Christianity Livingstone had long been valorised as an archetype of manliness. But in the Edwardian period, he was used even more explicitly to articulate a more vigorous and physical masculinity. One contemporary response to the crisis was to lay a new emphasis on the importance of “physical hardship” and fitness (Jones 2003:250), and so Livingstone’s biographers increasingly stressed his impressive fortitude and bodily capabilities.</p>

<p>Arthur Lincoln, for example, celebrated Livingstone’s “hard labour” and “Spartan training,” which had the effect of “inuring his body to hardship and privation” (Lincoln 1907:8). Likewise, in one of the bestselling biographies, <em>Livingstone the Pathfinder</em>, by London Missionary Society editor Basil Mathews, Livingstone appeared as a “hero-scout,” undeterred by “blistering plain and tangled forest,” defying “beast, savage men, marsh, forest, fever” (Mathews 1912:6, 108, 86).</p>

<p>Such authors, moreover, sought to address the crisis in British imperial masculinity by holding Livingstone up as an exemplary life and by directing their books towards younger readers. In Mathews’ case, we should also note the significance of repeatedly describing Livingstone as a “scout”; this made a direct connection to Baden Powell’s recent popular movement which, with its emphasis on physical reinvigoration and moral improvement, was itself a response to Edwardian anxieties about national health and imperial wellbeing (Boehmer 2004:xii).</p>

<p>While the tremendous suffering of the First World War struck a major blow to nineteenth-century heroic ideals, Livingstone’s reputation continued to flourish in the aftermath. It has been suggested that while military heroes were more difficult to lionise in the climate of post-war disillusionment, explorers like Livingstone and Robert Falcon Scott were able to provide a more amenable “epic of heroism for a generation tired of war” (Jones 2003:269). Yet, at the same time, the process of re-adaptation continued as the empire entered a new period and as imperialism was reformulated for a changing world.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, “trusteeship” became increasingly important in international discourse. While the idea had a long intellectual heritage, it developed in prominence in conjunction with the mandates system established by the League of Nations. The governing principle was that non-European territories were to be administered in “trust,” with the duty of developing the country to the benefit of its citizens (Bain 2003:99). As this concept was more explicitly articulated in British policy, Livingstone’s biographers made efforts to connect it to him.</p>

<p>For instance, the missionary writer W. P. Livingstone described “the mandate system” as essentially established on “Livingstone’s principle”: both shared the view, he felt, that “the well-being and development of native peoples form a sacred trust of civilization” (Livingstone 1929:124). The major biography of the period, by Reginald J. Campbell, similarly projected Livingstone as the architect of the present system: “it may with truth be said that it was chiefly he who made possible the moral trusteeship of the advanced over the backward races which is now a principle of the League of Nations [...] The British imperial Government has frankly admitted and applied the principle of trusteeship to all its dealings […] this was Livingstone’s vision” (Campbell 1929:20).</p>

<p>Shifts in imperial mentality continued to manifest themselves in the Livingstone works of the mid-twentieth century. The major book of the 1940s was undoubtedly <em>Livingstone’s Last Journey </em>by the celebrated Reginald Coupland, Beit Chair of Colonial History at Oxford. While the book is an impressive scholarly achievement, its significance here is the way in which it responded to the growing sense of imperial decline that was developing at the close of the Second World War. If the discipline of British imperial history, in its early and mid-twentieth century form, has sometimes been described as a “patriotic enterprise” that served to defend “contemporary British expansion,” this is certainly illustrated in the case of Coupland (Drayton 2011:675). He has been identified as an imperial apologist, who was confident in the moral authority and justice of British rule.</p>

<p>Indeed, <em>Livingstone’s Last Journey</em> was part of Coupland’s effort to interpret the imperial past as a humanitarian endeavour. The book dwells not only on Livingstone, but focuses on revealing what he contends was a crucial abolitionist network, a “triple alliance,” battling the Arab slave trade: “Livingstone, its spearhead, penetrating the black veil […] Kirk, his tried and trusted Lieutenant […] Waller […] with his hand on all the strings of the humanitarian movement” (Coupland 1945:32). It ends by celebrating the consummation of their efforts, when the treaties between Britain and Zanzibar in the 1870s struck a “mortal blow” to the slave trade. It was a striking “historical coincidence,” he suggested, that on the very day Livingstone died “the first blow was struck in a campaign which in three short years brought to its final triumph the cause to which he had given his life” (Coupland 1945:254).</p>

<p>Coupland’s celebratory history and his emphasis on Britain’s humanitarian intervention in global affairs must be read in the context of the United Kingdom’s diminishing world role and developing challenges to the empire. With Britain’s weakened position and with the growth of nationalist movements in the wake of the Second World War, it was recognized that the country needed to “set aside sentimental imperialism and take a realist view of our problems” (Clement Attlee, qtd. in Hyam 2006:94). Yet at an important juncture in imperial affairs, Coupland continued to valorize the past and perpetuate a narrative of heroic history. His book was a conservative effort in the face of political change, an attempt to inspire faith in imperialism at a moment when the British Empire was declining and anti-colonialism was on the rise.</p>

<p>Although British imperialism suffered a major blow in the Second World War, the end of empire was not immediate. While the Labour Party could declare in the late 1940s that “Imperialism is dead,” it could also claim that “the Empire has been given new life” (qtd. in Howe 1993:144). It was perceived that important work still remained for the British power to engage in, even in the changed context of the post-war world.</p>

<p>The concepts of “political advancement” and “partnership” were developed, as alternatives to the now questionable “imperialism” of the past. In some ways, “partnership” belonged in the tradition of imperial trusteeship (Bain 2003:116), but it represented a move away from paternalism and a greater emphasis on collaboration. It also implied more scope for colonial territories to eventually achieve self-government. At the same time, of course, it was a necessary reconceptualization of colonial relationships in the midst of the empire’s decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Coupland had recited the heroic story of Livingstone and the abolitionist “triple alliance” to counter imperial disenchantment, others engaged in the familiar pattern of remoulding Livingstone according to the now established creed. In 1957, for instance, Cecil Northcott wrote that “the growth of the idea of partnership between the races,” was “truly Livingstonian.” For him, “the gradual advancement of Africans into positions of authority in government and industry” directly followed what he called “The Livingstone Tradition” (Northcott 1957:79).</p>

<p>At the same time, Northcott gave Livingstone more direct political significance, applying him to a recent political formation in central Africa. The “intangible fields of ‘goodwill,’” he wrote, resulting from Livingstone’s travels, were sure to be “a practical asset, particularly on the life of the Federation” (Northcott 1957:77). Here, Northcott was referring to the Central African Federation, a controversial state that came into being in the 1950s and which united Nyasaland and both Southern and Northern Rhodesia. While European settlers had lobbied for this, it faced considerable opposition from Nyasaland’s black communities, who feared the influence of Southern Rhodesia’s “parallel development” policy.</p>

<p>Although the Federation was short lived, Northcott was not alone in casting Livingstone as its founder. For Michael Gelfand, historian and Professor of Medicine at the University of Rhodesia, Livingstone “was the driving force which led other men […] to seek the Central African field.” In Gelfand’s opinion, it was “not hard to see that the birth of the new Federation of Central Africa owes its existence to this early influence” (Gelfand 1957:13-14).</p>

<p>Gelfand’s scholarly interest lay in Livingstone’s medical contributions, but he was also clear that the explorer’s immediate relevance to the new federal state had motivated his biography: “Never has it been more necessary than at the present time in the history of Rhodesia and Nyasaland that we should try to understand the origins of this new state, for once we understand its beginning, we can prepare ourselves for the best way in which to ensure its welfare” (Gelfand 1957:xii).</p>

<p>Decolonisation ended the use of Livingstone on behalf of the projects of empire and, instead, brought a more sceptical eye to his life and posthumous reputation. Perhaps because of his political utility, Livingstone seems to have avoided critical biography until the 1970s: he was spared the debunking to which so many other heroic figures of the nineteenth century had been subject, from Lytton Strachey’s <em>Eminent Victorians </em>(1918) onwards.</p>

<p>With the political shifts in mentality that accompanied the end of empire, the saintly image of Livingstone began to be dismantled. George Martelli, for instance, aimed to part ways with “hero-worshippers” by writing a book “free of the excessive adulation which has characterised its predecessors” (Martelli 1970:ix). What emerged was a picture of a man of “imaginative enterprise, grit,” yet simultaneously “authoritarian and secretive” (Martelli 1970:242, x).</p>

<p>The critical approach was taken further by Judith Listowel, as well as by the most celebrated biography of Livingstone by Tim Jeal. While Jeal’s perspective – which he describes in his expanded bicentenary edition as a “revised orthodoxy” (Jeal 2013:xii) – was undoubtedly the result of rigorous research, it was also an approach fostered by the contemporary political and intellectual environment.</p>

<p>Jeal’s revisionism aimed to rebut long-established notions about one of Britain’s cherished heroes. While Livingstone may indeed have been “a great man,” he now appeared as “awkward, sullen,” “intolerant, narrow and self-opinionated” (Jeal 2001:371, 20, 25). Certainly, Livingstone was “courageous and resilient”, but this “did not make him likeable” (Jeal 2001:25). For Jeal, Livingstone was one of those who saw “his own wishes and personal preferences in terms of the dictates of Providence” (Jeal 2001:108). Motivated by ambition and not least by ego, “[t]he important thing was that he should lead and others follow” (Jeal 2001:108).</p>

<p>Although Jeal’s approach enlarged and productively challenged prevailing conceptions of the celebrated missionary and explorer, its conditions of possibility lay in the decolonisation of the 1960s and the end of Britain’s imperial age. Now, in a changing cultural climate, Livingstone was more open to critical reappraisal than he had been in the past: the time was ripe to deflate and debunk one of the empire’s established icons.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Postcolonial Rewriting</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>If the end of empire contributed to biographical reinterpretation, it is also worth noting that this period gave rise to creative literature that took Livingstone as its subject. Since there are very few fictional texts that engaged with Livingstone prior to the second half of the twentieth century, this form of rewriting seems primarily indebted to the rise of the postcolonial movement. Broadly speaking, postcolonial criticism has aimed to reconsider the history of colonialism “from the perspectives of those who suffered its effects” (Young 2001:4). It is a committed critique, closely connected with the anti-colonial and nationalist struggles prior to decolonisation.</p>

<p class="space1" style="line-height:110%"><a href="/sites/default/files/life-and-times/livingstone-s-posthumous-reputation/liv_012015_0019-crop-article.jpg"><img alt="Scenes in Hot Latitudes and Travels in Search of the Wishi Washi to its Junction with the Puddi Muddi.

<span style="font-size:12px;"><em>Scenes in Hot Latitudes and Travels in Search of the Wishi Washi to its Junction with the Puddi Muddi</em>. This complex image, dating from the 1880s, engages in crude racial caricature while also aiming to satirise Livingstone and the European presence in Africa. It is included here to illustrate the historical stereotypes that postcolonialism would contest and critique. <em>Courtesy of the Smithsonian Libraries, Washington, D.C. </em></span></p>

<p>It also emphasises the relationship between culture and politics, pointing to the importance that “cultural representations” played within the colonial project (Boehmer 1995:5). Resisting colonialism was thus not only about seeking political freedom, but about emancipating the consciousness and rejecting the cultural values that colonialism imposed. Much postcolonial literature then has taken an oppositional stance towards the former imperial metropole, contesting and deconstructing colonial ideology.</p>

<p>As an established hero of empire, Livingstone was caught up in this project. For instance, in her fictional travelogue, <em>Looking for Livingstone</em>, Canadian-Caribbean author Marlene NourbeSe Philip aims to confront the European myth of “discovery.” By recounting the journey of a nameless female “Traveller,” pursuing “Dr Livingstone,” Philip’s prose-poem responds to the familiar narrative of exploration: here, however, Livingstone is the object rather than the agent of discovery.</p>

<p>For Philip, European exploration was really a form of appropriation, dependent on the knowledge of local peoples. When the Traveller and Livingstone finally meet she rebuts his claim to discovery, stripping him of credit: “You’re nothing but a cheat and a liar, Livingstone-I-presume. Without the African,” she exclaims, “you couldn’t have done anything” (Philip 1991:62).</p>

<p>For the Traveller, moreover, exploration was a form of conquest. Livingstone and “all those other explorers” operated under the logic of “Discover and possess – one and the same thing. And destroy” (Philip 1991:15). In her effort to rewrite history – which she describes as “like talking to Livingstone and telling him a few things” – Philip both satirises Livingstone and subjects him to imaginative violence (Carey 1991:19).</p>

<p>There is much more to say about the complex thematics of this novel, but the point to note here is that Philip’s iconoclasm is connected to Livingstone’s prior history as a symbol of the colonial past: it is his iconic value which enables him to serve as a focal point of her critical imperative.</p>

<p>Philip is not alone in her approach. For instance, Lennart Hagerfors’s novel <em>The Whales in Lake Tanganyika</em> narrates Stanley’s journey in pursuit of Livingstone from the perspective of one of the expedition members, John William Shaw. When Stanley – envisaged here as sadistic and deranged – finally finds Livingstone, we are met with an image that conspicuously departs from heroic characterisation. Livingstone looks “like an injured bird that couldn’t fly”: with his “apelike arms” and “skinny and bowed legs,” we are told, he “resembled a chimpanzee” (Hagerfors 1991:163).</p>

<p>To some extent, the aim here is to reduce Livingstone’s stature and subject him to scorn. By laughing at Livingstone, Hagerfors reacts against heroic history and deflates European pride in the colonial and civilising mission. Yet the implication is also that Livingstone has been transformed by his experience: rather than colonising Africa, it has colonised him.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Hagerfors is casting Africa as a space of degeneration or relying on the familiar trope of “going native.” Instead, Livingstone’s decline suggests the breakdown of values that no longer hold; he has been chastened, domesticated, reduced by his experience. He is alienated from his “native tongue,” which now “sounds frightful,” while talk of Europe fills him with “terror” (Hagerfors 1991:168, 170). The European assumptions brought him to Africa have been vanquished and he now listens instead of preaching. Where once Livingstone had possessed the confidence to speak with “a mouth as large as a cathedral,” now “all that remains of [him] is an ear” (Hagerfors 1991:168).</p>

<p>With their commitment to postcolonial revision, Philip and Hagerfors take Livingstone and rewrite him for political purposes. Other authors have engaged in similar projects.&nbsp; For instance, in his play, <em>Livingstone and Sechele</em>, David Pownall imagines the missionary’s interactions with his convert Sechele, in order to offer reflections on the complex interaction between Christianity and colonialism.</p>

<p>Such works are generally less interested in interrogating Livingstone as an historical subject than in responding to his status as an iconic figure of the imperial past. But while these representations do not primarily aim for historical accuracy, they demonstrate clearly the malleability of the historical life and the impact of socio-political commitments on interpretation. For these authors, oriented in opposition to imperialism, Livingstone took on new meanings.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that other creative writers have put Livingstone to different use. In a play entitled <em>The Last Journey</em>, South African author and political activist Alan Paton retold the story of the porters who transported Livingstone’s body to the coast after his death, as an African epic. Written in the context of escalating racial segregation, the play’s purpose was to oppose the apartheid system. Similarly, again writing from an apartheid context, Nadine Gordimer drew on passages from Livingstone’s journals in order to offer critique of white racism in her short story, “Livingstone’s Companions.”</p>

<p>In this essay I have focused on biography, followed by a brief foray into fiction and drama. Yet Livingstone has been commemorated in other forms too. His death in 1873, for instance, inspired a profusion of elegiac poetry expressing a sense of loss and public grief (Livingstone 2012; Livingstone 2014). Livingstone has also been depicted on the big screen. Marmaduke Arundel Wetherell’s 1925 film is perhaps the most interesting British production. Shot in various African locations that Livingstone had himself visited, the final footage contained striking scenes of landscape and wildlife.</p>

<p>While the movie presented a conventional narrative of Livingstone’s life, the producers had particular purposes in mind in staging his story on screen. From the initial plans to the later publicity the film received, it is clear that it was motivated by concerns over the dubious moral and cultural influence of Hollywood flicks. This “all British masterpiece” was intended to inspire patriotic and imperial sentiment, and to provide a wholesome alternative to the influx of American films increasingly dominating British cinema (Rapp and Weber 1989:8, 3).</p>

<p>Hollywood, however, decided to take up the Livingstone story as well and in 1939, 20th Century Fox released its own blockbuster. Starring big names like Spencer Tracy and Cedric Hardwicke, this production focused on Stanley’s quest to find Livingstone. Contrasting Stanley’s American vigor with the torpor of the various British characters, the film implies that the older custodians of civilisation are in need of rejuvenation by a younger more energetic nation.</p>

<p>At the end, when Stanley adopts Livingstone’s mantle and sets out on new African adventures – to the soundtrack of “Onward Christian Soldiers” – the film emphasises the joint work of Britain and America in upholding Christian civilisation (Pettitt 2007:122). Released just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, this message of a shared transatlantic vision undoubtedly appeared at an important political juncture.</p>

<p>This essay has offered a brief overview of Livingstone’s evolving literary legacy. Adopting a metabiograpical approach and focusing on imperial contexts, it has demonstrated the ways in which he has been represented and put to work for particular political purposes. There are other strands of Livingstone’s posthumous reputation that are also worthy of attention – for instance, the relationship it bore to changing Scottish and British national identities (Livingstone 2014). And while the approach here has been primarily textual, there is scope for future research on other means of remembrance. For instance, Livingstone has been extensively commemorated in monumental form, with statues appearing in Edinburgh in 1876 and Glasgow in 1879, and a memorial church in Blantyre in 1877.</p>

<p>Here, however, we have traced the ways in which Livingstone has been remoulded according to the changing ideological needs of empire, from the height of late Victorian imperialism to the period of colonial decline and beyond. The outline that I’ve offered, it should be acknowledged, does not do full justice to the range of representations of Livingstone that can be detected at any one historical moment. Rather than being simply mapped onto a political context, Livingstone was constructed in dialogue with it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the aim here has been to delineate broad patterns, to identify political shifts that conspicuously transfigured the way that biographers approached his life and his contemporary relevance. To the Victorians, Livingstone was a pioneer of partition; to the Edwardians, a model of imperial manliness; following World War One, he was seen as the inspiration behind trusteeship, and later as the pioneer of partnership and the Central African Federation.</p>

<p>Following decolonisation and the discrediting of empire, the way was clear for more hostile revision and Livingstone soon began to appear in less heroic guise. Extending the metabiographical method to include creative literature opens the parameters to texts that pressed the critical approach further and that directly responded to his imperial legacy: written from a committed postcolonial perspective, with its politico-intellectual orientation, these works set out to critique one of the British Empire’s foremost icons.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s ‘afterlife’ of course remains ongoing: the posthumous reputation of an historical subject is perhaps never a finished business. As political and cultural contexts continue to evolve, David Livingstone will doubtless continue to be re-visited, re-written and re-constructed.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> is a data-driven project. We promote access to and use of our entire digital collection. We work in a transparent and accountable manner. We seek to ensure the long-term digital preservation of our core data. As a result, we rely on a set of well-defined practices, standards, and arrangements to realize these objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Code of conduct.</strong> The <a href="/behind-scenes/livingstone-online-code"><em>Livingstone Online</em> Code</a> sets out ideals that guide our work and determine our day-to-day collaboration with individuals and institutions around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Open access and use.</strong> By design, we have made nearly all of <em>Livingstone Online</em> freely accessible to the public-at-large. We encourage the broad non-commercial use of our materials and, whenever possible, try to secure <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licenses for the materials we publish in an effort to promote educational dissemination.</p>

<p><strong>User-friendly design.</strong> The <em>Livingstone Online</em> interface seeks to create a user-friendly experience. We have invested significant effort in developing a site that is easy to navigate, intuitive, and aesthetically enriching. We have also conducted extensive testing and have collaborated with a variety of end-users in an attempt to ensure that our site is as glitch- and bug-free as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Quality control.</strong> Our image and transcription data and metadata undergo rigorous quality control. Each element of our core data passes through at least four stages of review, often much more, prior to online publication. Based on our quality control practices, we conservatively estimate our data production error rate to be about 5%, although in most cases the error rate is probably much lower.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation.</strong> Our project is the result of a sustained, decade-long collaboration among a variety of entities. We strive to make all of our work as open as possible, as befits a publicly-funded project. In this spirit, we offer rich project histories that record every stage of project development via narrative text, images, and downloadable project documents. We encourage other interested parties to study and learn from our efforts as part of our mission to facilitate digital humanities knowledge transfer.</p>

<p><strong>Credit.</strong> <em>Livingstone Online</em> is a collaborative project to which a wide range of individuals have made contributions of varying sorts. We have developed a complex credit model in order to recognize these contributions. Our model consists of several components:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our <a href="/behind-scenes/livingstone-onlines-staff">staff</a> page identifies and cites the roles of the core members of the <em>Livingstone Online</em> initiative as a whole.</li>
	<li>Our <a href="/behind-scenes/project-teams">project team</a> pages list the participants responsible for developing <em>Livingstone Online</em>\'s editions and other projects.</li>
	<li>Our main <a href="/behind-scenes/acknowledgments">acknowledgments</a> page enumerates the many individuals who are not <em>Livingstone Online</em> core or project team members, but who nonetheless have made important contributions to our work. There are also acknowledgment pages for the <a href="/spectral-imaging/acknowledgments">1870</a> and <a href="/spectral-imaging/acknowledgments-1">1871</a> Field Diaries and the <a href="/spectral-imaging/acknowledgments-0">Letter from Bambarre</a>.</li>
	<li>Our project histories describe and define collaborator contributions in more detail (see sub-section on "Documentation," above).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> thus aspires to digital humanities best practice through the combination of these strategies and seeks to foster a collaborative environment where the work of contributors is not only valued, but also recognized in a manner that does justice to their contributions and, ulimately, benefits both the contributors and the project as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution.</strong> Our project has a standardized system for the attribution of individual site essays. As relevant, we identify first, second, and third authors as well as editors, peer-reviewing editors, and other such individuals. By default, the individuals who appear in the byline of a given piece are first authors unless otherwise specified: "Megan Ward" or "Megan Ward and Adrian S. Wisnicki." We use "with" to signal one or more second authors and "also with" to signal one or more third authors: "Ashanka Kumari, with Adrian S. Wisnicki, also with Keith Knox and Megan Ward." If necessary, parenthetical information may be added to distinguish between roles: "Adrian S. Wisnicki, with Megan Ward (authors); Justin Livingstone (peer-reviewing editor)."</p>

<p><strong>Permissions.</strong> We take the rights of our collaborators seriously. All items published on <em>Livingstone Online</em> appear by permission. In all cases, we have secured permissions and agreements in writing in order to confirm the terms by which institutions and individuals have made items available to us and to ensure that we have written documentation available in the future, should any questions about collaborator agreements arise. For easy reference, we retain copies of all written permissions and agreements in the back end of our Drupal site using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/filedepot" target="_blank">Filedepot</a> integrated file management module. Wherever relevant, we prominently display the ownership, rights, and terms of use for the items we publish directly on our site.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Data Production Standards</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p><strong>File naming.</strong> The base file name of each item in our digital collection consists of only a "liv" prefix plus a unique six-digit item number. The item number has no meaning, and we make it a practice not to put any bibliographic information into our file names. Rather we keep all such information in our metadata files. Click <a href="#psa5">here</a> for more detail on how we use file names.</p>

<p><strong>Images.</strong> When possible, we request 8-bit TIFF images at 600 dpi created to the 6.0 TIFF specification from our collaborating institutions, and we provide the institutions with a clear set of imaging guidelines. However, we have collected our core image data from an array of institutions over a ten-year period (2004-present). As a result, variations in image capture methods and specifications have been inevitable, due to differing institutional protocols and ongoing methodological changes in fields such as library science, imaging science, and the digital humanities.</p>

<p>Our usual practice is to crop images to one image per manuscript page, if images do not already conform to this format. However, we do not normally crop out any contexutal elements that may appear in an image, such as color charts or rulers, in the interests of giving users as much information as possible. Also, when we crop images, we always retain an archival backup copy of the uncropped image.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Hosting, Site Setup, and Backup Arrangements</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p><strong>Site hosting.</strong> The University of Maryland Libraries host <em>Livingstone Online</em> in an <a href="http://islandora.ca/" target="_blank">Islandora framework</a>. The Islandora framework combines a front-end <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal content management system</a> (version 7.34 for <em>Livingstone Online</em>) with a back-end <a href="http://fedorarepository.org/" target="_blank">Fedora digital asset management system</a>. Thanks to this arrangement, <em>Livingstone Online</em> is integrated within the overall collection of the Libraries and so can be preserved and maintained as part of that larger collection.</p>

<p><strong>Development access. </strong>An agreement between the University of Maryland Libraries and the <em>Livingstone Online</em> project team sets out the responsibilities of the Libraries in hosting the site and defines the basis on which the project team can access and develop all the site\'s content.</p>

<p><strong>Site Setup. </strong><em>Livingstone Online</em> is built and deployed using a number of different tools. At the heart of our system, we use <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> for deployment of code and dependencies, and <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> for storing and managing code and configuration. We have a number of <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline" target="_blank">Github Repositories</a> where we share our code and configuration. These repositories fall into three categories:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Docker related - used to build Docker image(s) that are deployed to the server (prefixed with <em>docker-</em>);</li>
	<li>Code related - used by the site to implement functionality (prefixed with <em>livingstone_online_</em>); and</li>
	<li>Unrelated - not related to site setup (for instance, MODS files, TEI files, etc.).</li>
</ol>

<p>Docker images are built automatically when changes are made to the repositories identified above. This is performed by the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/livingstoneonline/" target="_blank">Docker Hub service</a>. After Docker images are built they are automatically deployed by the <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline/docker-auto-deploy" target="_blank">Docker auto deploy</a> application running on the site server. More information about the site setup is available <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline#livingstone-online" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Site versions.</strong> Our project team uses two online versions of the site for development: stage and production. Stage provide iterations of the site where our programmers can experiment with design and test changes to code, while production provides the public-facing version of the site. Programmers also work with local versions of the site on their own computers.</p>

<p><strong>Data and site backup.</strong> We employ multiple strategies to backup <em>Livingstone Online</em>\'s data. The University of Maryland Libraries create nightly incremental backups of the site using Commvault data protection systems, and deleted files are retained for fourteen days after deletion. All <em>Livingstone Online</em> data is also duplicated to tape storage held in the UMD Libraries secure server room. Code, including TEI and MODS files, is versioned in <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The site\'s Drupal database is backed up automatically to our production server on a daily basis using Drupal\'s Backup and Migrate module, while the whole Drupal files directory is also sync\'d via a cron job to an external server. Finally, the project director maintains local backups of all core project data on a series of computers, external hard drives, and remote servers.</p>

<p>Each item in our collection receives only a simple base file name:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_000455</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_013013</p>

<p>Images receive an additional four digit segment that identifies the specific image in the item sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_000005_0003.tif</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_000005_0004.tif</p>

<p>MODS and TEI files have the relevant acronyms added to the base file name:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_000149_MODS.xml</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_002010_TEI.xml</p>

<p>Consequently, the base file names enable the easy association and organization of all files related to an item, while additions to this name and/or file suffixes allow differentiation among the files:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_000017 <em>– base file name</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">liv_000017_0001.jpg <em>– JPEG image file</em></p>

<p>The first of Livingstone’s field diaries from his final expedition to Africa (1866-73) begins with Livingstone’s departure for Africa from France. Livingstone opens with a series of addresses in French, noting that his daughter Agnes will remain in Paris to practice her French. Livingstone travels from Marseilles to Malta, where the ship is quarantined due to cholera. They then sail to Alexandria, Egypt, then overland to Cairo, then on to the Gulf of Aden and from there to Bombay, India.</p>

<p>Once in Bombay, Livingstone is reunited with his “men from the Zambesi,” the porters he left in Bombay before returning to England on a previous trip (Livingstone 1865:[54]). He also sells the Lady Nyassa, the steamer he built and sailed to Bombay with those same men. While in Bombay, Livingstone records observations of the British colonial community in Bombay and gives several lectures, all the while drumming up support from the Sultan of Zanzibar and looking for additional men to go on with him to Africa. In January 1866, he sets sail for Zanzibar and in March 1866, continues on from Zanzibar to Rovuma, on the western coast of Africa. This is where the narrative account ends.</p>

<p>From here, the notebook shifts from narrative descriptions to a more dispersed set of notations, written with the book flipped upside-down. In the final third of the diary, we find a few figures, such as a genealogical chart, a map, and a drawing of ship’s prow. In addition, there are wage calculations for his porters and records of local measures, such as “Gora – 15 cloths of 4 cubits each” (Livingstone 1865:[98]). These are interspersed with quotations from British explorer and Livingstone’s predecessor John Hanning Speke (1827-65), noting that Speke was unable to “converse in any African language until [he and his men] were close to the coast on the return Journey” (Livingstone 1865:[98]). Accounts of the trip costs at the end of the diary have early dates (4-9 August 1865), which suggest that Livingstone divided the notebook up this way from the beginning, using the two different text directions to separate the narratives from the notebook\'s other functions of calculations, lists, and other jottings.</p>

<p>Covered in damaged green silk, this hard-back book has a side binding. Livingstone writes mostly in blue pencil, with the occasional grey pencil entry, and a few words and numbers in ink, perhaps added in later. Entries range from a few lines to a few pages, often separated by a horizontal line across the page. The frontispiece includes a summary of the diary’s contents, written by Rev. James McNair, founding of the David Livingstone Center in Blantyre, Scotland. Written in the late 1940s- early 1950s, the summary notes that there are dates that do not correspond with Horace Waller’s edition of Livingstone’s <em>Last Journals</em> (1874). On the back inner cover, this field diary, like the others held by the David Livingstone Centre, bears a pasted-in bookplate from the Stirling University Library Conservation Project relating to a conservation effort from the 1980s. Though Livingstone brought a supply of top-bound pocket notebooks with him, this side-bound book is the one he chose to begin his final travels to Africa.</p>

<p>Research for our critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts has resulted in the production of a considerable amount of supporting documentation. This documentation encompasses all aspects of the project and, as a whole, offers an intimate glimpse into project development. The documentation takes a variety of forms, from emails among project team members, grant application files, project plans, and spreadsheets of processing objectives, to meeting and research notes, test images, metadata-addition scripts, and PowerPoint presentations. Altogether, we provide curated access to some 300 project documents (broadly defined) spanning three years of research activities (2013-16) among an internationally distributed team of collaborators and supporting institutions.</p>

<p>The directors have curated this documentation in a handful of ways. First, we have organized the documentation into categories of project endeavor in order to facilitate study of individual files or file sequences. As part of this, we have removed duplicate or variant files with the goal of being representative (rather than exhaustive) about our research. Second, documentation files have been renamed to reflect the contents and actual order of research activities (although, as users will find, research activities did not always take an organized form and involved much trial and error). Finally, we have lightly edited the documentation to remove personal information or other sensitive material such as passwords.</p>

<p>Our practices in curating the documentation thus reflect those applied to <a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2017">LEAP: The <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project</a> and our prior spectral imaging research project on <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary</a>. We release this documentation under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a> license in keeping with <em>Livingstone Online</em>\'s general mission of promoting knowledge transfer and conducting transparent, publicly-accountable research.</p>

<p>In this edition, we call each sheet of paper on which Livingstone has written any portion of his diary a <strong>leaf</strong>. Each side of each leaf is a <strong>folio</strong>. Thus, every leaf consists of two folia, the one on the recto and the one on the verso. Finally, each folio may contain either one Livingstone diary <strong>page</strong> (covering the whole folio on which is appears) or two Livingstone diary <strong>pages </strong>(side by side on the folio on which they appear). The diary pages may be numbered or unnumbered.</p>

<p>Field Diary II picks up where the <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-i-overview">previous diary</a> left off, as Livingstone and his men leave the eastern coast of Africa and begin their trek inland. As in the previous diary, an opening note (c. late 1940s-early 1950s) from Rev. James McNair indicates that he has assessed the similarity between this account and the one published in Horace Waller\'s edited <em>Last Journals</em> (1874). This diary is "the basis for the entries in the \'Last Journal,\'" writes McNair; divergences "have been penciled where noticed" (Livingstone 1866a:[3]). The note suggests that even from this early date Livingstone scholars and enthusiasts were interested in how his account has been shaped by the publication process.</p>

The area covered by this map roughly corresponds to the area through which Livingstone passed while writing Field Diary II. The map traces the expedition\'s route from the East African coast into the interior.</span></p>

<p>Field Diary II describes Livingstone\'s travels with a group of men that includes Sepoys, "Johanna men" (a group hired at Johanna [Anjouan] Island to accompany Livingstone), and "Nassickers" (men from his previous trip who were educated at the Nassick school for freed slaves in Nashik, India while Livingstone was in England between journeys). In addition, Livingstone hires an Arab guide, Ali, for this portion of the trip, and also day laborers from the Makonde, an African ethnic group, to clear the path and carry things (Livingstone 1866a:[21]).</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s tone at starting out is positive; though the path is often overgrown, they make steady progress. His interactions with local headmen appear uncomplicated; for instance, he notes simply "The old man Monyink? presented a goat and I gave him 2 fathoms of calico" (Livingstone 1866a:[28]). By 10 April 1866, his men become afflicted by malaria (or, as Livingstone simply calls it, fever), though they respond quickly to treatment. From this point forward, the diary periodically logs the illnesses and treatments of men and animals (donkeys, camels, cows, and dogs).</p>

<p>As these illnesses take their toll and the route becomes more difficult, the tone of the diary changes from hopeful to worried. Conflicts also emerge among Livingstone\'s men. Livingstone documents his struggles to mediate among the men and also to maintain his authority as incidents of theft, fighting, and punishment arise. This is difficult not only within the group, but also because Livingstone worries that whatever punishment he delivers "would be commented on by the Makonde" (Livingstone 1866a:[70]). Throughout the diary, Livingstone interweaves his own memories of conflicts with the Makonde from his previous journey as well as accounts from Ali, using these accounts to explain the "awe" or even "fear" with which the Makonde treat the English (Livingstone 1866a:[56]).</p>

<p>While traveling, Livingstone records details of the local climate and topography as well as observations about Makonde language, culture, and appearance. Some of this is first-hand observation, as when he writes, "many of the men profusely tattooed - teeth sharpened to points they say for beauty" (Livingstone 1866a:[99]). Other times, it is hearsay, as when he notes, "they are said to fear the English - They sell each other to the Arabs" (Livingstone 1866a:[56]). He concludes the diary with a long entry on his wish that he could act as a missionary on this journey (though he does not) and meditates on the Biblical doctrine of individual "inborn sin" as compared to the "natural sense of justice" he has observed of the Makonde as a whole (Livingstone 1866a:[104], [105]).</p>

This field diary map corresponds to the middle segments of the more polished map shown above. Together the maps offer an excellent example of the manner in which Livingstone revised and integrated his cartograhic observations.</span></p>

<p>This diary takes the same material form as <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-i-overview">Field Diary I</a>, a hardback book with a green silk cover that has become ragged with time, measuring 152mm high by 95mm wide and 9mm thick. The writing flips upside down on p. 101, suggesting that, as in the first field diary, Livingstone writes from the front and back simultaneously. Seven sketches are mixed with Livingstone\'s writing, and the final two pages comprise a large map with the spine oriented horizontally through the middle. This map is dated 2 May 1866 and documents rock formations, the lands of different ethnic groups, and a route that marks "brackish water" through the Metambwe valley, Nangadi lakelet, and Urongwe lakelet (Livingstone 1866a:[107]).</p>

<p>The present edition encompasses the entire manuscript corpus related to Livingstone\'s final expedition to Africa (1865-73) held by the David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre, Scotland. This set of documents is possibly the most comprehensive and diverse surviving collection of manuscripts related to any single nineteenth-century British expedition to Africa.</p>

<p>Collectively the manuscripts cover a broad range of subjects, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cultural observations related to a variety of African ethnic groups</li>
	<li>the complexities of Livingstone’s relationships with Arab and African slave traders;</li>
	<li>the famous meeting with Henry Morton Stanley (“Dr. Livingstone, I presume?”) and the subsequent travels of the two men together (1871-72);</li>
	<li>African fables recorded by Livingstone in the field;</li>
	<li>geological and astronomical notes;</li>
	<li>observations on the African climate;</li>
	<li>Livingstone’s theories of the Nile River system and the central African watershed;</li>
	<li>vocabularies from African populations such as the Swahili, Batusi, Baganda, Manyema, Masai, Lunda, and Kavirondo;</li>
	<li>reflective essays on diverse topics, including the East African slave trade, Darwin and natural selection, the American Civil War, and African history;</li>
	<li>day-to-day diary entries and sketches from Livingstone\'s travels over large portions of eastern, south central, and central Africa.</li>
</ul>

<p>The materials represent multiple stages of manuscript production, from notes and sketches drafted hurriedly in the field to thoroughly developed narratives and detailed maps. The materials also complement the manuscripts from the final journey published by the <a href="/spectral-imaging">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, Horace Waller edited, radically revised, and published a limited assortment of these manuscripts as the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874). For the last 140 years, this published work has served as the primary source for this period of Livingstone’s life, his travels, and the many aspects of nineteenth-century African history that he recorded.</p>

<p>Our edition begins the work of a full-scale re-evaluation of these materials. We present the manuscripts in our edition in one of three forms: 1) as high-resolution images with critically encoded text and full metadata, 2) as high-resolution images with full metadata, and 3) in encoded digital facsimile form. We also include a set of supporting critical materials to illuminate the manuscripts and facilitate further critical exploration.</p>

Such Victorian photographs (and, in this case, their captions) exemplify the complexities inherent in nineteenth-century source materials related to David Livingstone. This photograph recognizes the often hidden contributions of non-Western companions, such as Susi and Chuma, to the project of British exploration. The photograph also presents the manuscripts at center (most of which are published in the present edition) in one of their historical contexts. However, the photograph also also appears to objectify Susi and Chuma by presenting them as curios amidst other curios, including the head of a lion at lower left. The image is one of a series taken of Susi and Chuma with Livingstone\'s artifacts.

<p>The pages of the 1870 Field Diary record the long and complex history of this fascinating manuscript, one of the most visually arresting and textually intriguing documents produced by British nineteenth-century travel in Africa.</p>

<p>Until the work of the present project team, this history has remained largely unknown.</p>

<p>However, recourse to existing documentation, close analysis of the manuscript, reasonable inference, and, most importantly, use of advanced spectral imaging technology have now enabled us to recover and reconstruct the diary’s history in a detailed and comprehensive manner.</p>

<p>This section concludes our analysis of the state of the 1870 Field Diary manuscript by summarizing the previously documented history of the 1870 Field Diary and by using our findings in the other parts of this essay to develop a comprehensive new chronology of the manuscript that relies on the evidence of the diary pages themselves – in other words, a chronology that underscores the considerable potential of spectral imaging technology to expand our understanding of Livingstone’s diary and, potentially, those of other nineteenth-century British travel writers.</p>

<p>The <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0" target="_blank">first phase</a> of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project (2010-13) documented most of the known history of the 1870 Field Diary (a.k.a. Bambarre Field Diary) along with that of the 1871 Field Diary (a.k.a. Nyangwe Field Diary), both of which might also be grouped under a single heading (Manyema Field Diary). As a result, that history need not be repeated here other than a brief recap and, as relevant, the addition of a few bits of information specific to the 1870 Field Diary.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the field diaries and journals from Livingstone final expedition (1866-73) followed one of three trajectories before their arrival in Britain. Livingstone entrusted the massive Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) to Henry Morton Stanley in March 1872, and Stanley carried that journal back to Britain where it became the basis for Horace Waller’s edition of the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874). Livingstone kept another fourteen field diaries from the final expedition (field diaries I-XIII [1866-71] plus one from a previous expedition) in a box at Ujiji, where the British explorer Verney Lovett Cameron recovered them in February 1874, after Livingstone’s death. These arrived too late to be of use to Waller. Finally, Livingstone carried the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries plus a handful of other diaries (field diaries XIV-XVII [1871-73]) with him until his death in present-day Zambia in 1873. These diaries also accompanied Livingstone’s body back to Britain.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">"Visit of Arabs to Livingstone and Stanley at Unyanyembe," from a review of Henry M. Stanley\'s "How I Found Livingstone," <em>Illustrated London News</em>, 20 (1872), 485. <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/scotland/" target="_blank&quot;">Creative Commons Share-alike 2.5 UK: Scotland</a></em>. It was in Unyanyembe that Livingstone parted with Stanley and entrusted to him the massive journal that now bears the name of the village.</span></p>

<p>Once back in Britain, the 1870 Field Diary (and at least a part of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>) passed to Livingstone’s daughter Agnes. Agnes then transcribed these materials – including portions of the 1870 Field Diary that seem no longer to survive in the original (Livingstone 1870d, 1870g) – for Horace Waller, Livingstone’s friend and editor, who later recognized her efforts (Waller, in Livingstone 1874,1:iv). Agnes’s handwritten transcription was typeset, revised, and soon became the basis for the relevant portion of the <em>Last Journals</em>. Recourse to the 1870 Field Diary, in this case, occurred in part because the diary – in contrast to Livingstone’s other final field diaries – offers a more detailed account of the given period than the Unyanyembe Journal, which Waller usually used in the first instance.</p>

<p>After preparation and publication of the <em>Last Journals</em>, the pages of the 1870 Field Diary passed to the Livingstone family, where they were held, apparently, before being distributed to various repositories. The first four pages of the second gathering (Livingstone 1870c), for instance, remained with the branch of the Livingstone family that descends from Agnes Livingstone and that includes Diana Livingstone Bruce, great-granddaughter of David Livingstone. Diana Livingstone Bruce gifted these pages (along with a variety of Livingstone letters addressed to Agnes, Mary Moffat [Agnes’s mother and Livingstone’s wife], and Robert Moffat [Agnes’s maternal grandfather]) to the British Library in 1860, where the pages have remained ever since.</p>

<p>Another set of pages (Livingstone 1870e, 1870i, 1870k, 1871b, 1871e, i.e., the bulk of the pages) passed to the branch of the Livingstone family that descends from Anna Mary Livingstone Wilson, another Livingstone daughter, and that includes Hubert F. Wilson, Livingstone’s grandson. The latter deposited these pages, along with 68 letters and the first draft of part of Livingstone’s first book <em>Missionary Travels</em> (1857), with the National Library of Scotland in 1965. The Livingstone family then subsequently donated these pages of the library, where these pages have since remained.</p>

<p>Finally, the remaining pages (Livingstone 1870b, 1870f, 1870h, 1870j, 1871a) have a more complex history, as <a href="http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/1871diary/manuscript4.htm" target="_blank">already detailed</a> by the first phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project. These pages also passed to the Wilson branch of the Livingstone family, and this branch gifted them to the Scottish National Memorial to David Livingstone (now the David Livingstone Centre) on one more or more uncertain dates between the end of the 1920s and the period directly after World War II.</p>

<p>The pages then remained at the Centre until at least 1975; traveled to the National Library of Scotland in the late 1970s, where they were copied as part of the Livingstone Documentation Project; were erroneously handed off to the John Murray archive in London; then returned to the Centre at some indefinite point, probably in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>From the Centre, the pages made one final trip in March 1986 to Stirling University for conversation, returned to the Centre in May 1987, and then disappeared from view until rediscovered by Centre’s archivist Anne Martin in 2009 due to a research request from Adrian S. Wisnicki, director of the present critical edition.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2010, the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project brought together nearly all the known pages of the 1870 Field Diary (and the 1871 Field Diary for that matter) at the National Library of Scotland for a <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-history-1#link10">two-week period</a>. Here the project team spectrally imaged all the pages, plus a number of contemporaneous letters. These images form the basis of the present critical edition.</p>

<p class="space-1">1863-1870</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:1.5em;">
	<li>Prior to his last journey (1866-73), Livingstone obtained at least two of the printed texts (see 1870a and 1870e/1870i/1870j/1870k) that he would assemble into the 1870 Field Diary. The second of these texts dates to 1863, but it is unknown when Livingstone acquired his copy.</li>
	<li>Individuals other than Livingstone wrote on and folded two of the source texts (see 1870c, 1870h) that would eventually become part of the 1870 Field Diary, then sent these documents to Livingstone in central Africa. This process included the addition of stamps and postmarks to the first of these.</li>
	<li>Individuals other than Livingstone folded or otherwise assembled two other printed source texts (1871a/1871b and 1871e), then also sent these on to Livingstone in Africa.</li>
	<li>Livingstone received the handwritten and printed texts cited above while traveling in central Africa during his last expedition (1866-73), the last of the texts (1871e) potentially arriving in February 1871 along with the copy of <em>The Standard</em> over which Livingstone wrote the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a> (see 1871f).</li>
	<li>Livingstone read and, in one case, used gray then red pencil to annotate one of the source texts (see 1870e/1870i/1870j/1870k).</li>
	<li>Livingstone used a smattering of other source text pages for various ad hoc calculations and maps made in pencil and brown and black iron gall ink.</li>
	<li>As Livingstone made his ad hoc notes, he (or perhaps one or more individuals who handled the relevant texts before him) also dropped or spilled various unknown substances onto the leaves of the texts. Today these substances appear as brown, red, and other stains (some not visible to the naked eye) beneath Livingstone’s handwritten 1870 Field Diary text.</li>

<p class="space-1">1870-1873</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:1.5em;">
	<li>Livingstone composed and revised the 1870 Field Diary by writing his entries over the source texts.
	<ul>
		<li>He carried out this work (presumably) between 1870 and 1871.</li>
		<li>The work included a complex process of constructing the diary out of the source texts.</li>
		<li>Livingstone did all this composition and revision work in various shades of brown iron gall ink.</li>
		<li>As part of the composition process, Livingstone wrote around some pre-existing page folds and tears in the pages.</li>
		<li>He used some page folds to structure the placement of his handwritten text on the page.</li>
		<li>Livingstone also did not necessarily compose the diary pages in strict numerical or chronological sequence. He numbered some pages in advance of writing on them and returned to other pages after he had written on them to make both minor and major additions or revisions.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Livingstone assembled the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary (1870b) into a booklet and bound it with a piece of twine that survives to the present day.</li>
	<li>Livingstone also, apparently, used twine looped through a sequence of pages from the second gathering (1870i:XXI-LV) to hold those pages together, although that twine does not survive and the pages are today unbound.</li>
	<li>At some point, something made a faint oval impression on multiple pages of the second gathering of the diary (1870e, 1870i, 1870j, 1870k, 1871a, 1871b). This impression may be due to the interaction of printed ink on the page and humidity in the African environment or may be the result of a paperweight that Livingstone used to hold down his pages as he wrote.</li>
	<li>The diary suffered damage when someone saturated a series of pages from the second gathering (1870i:XXXVII-LXI) with what appears to be water. This saturation resulted in the blotting, bleed through, and pronounced staining of long sections of Livingstone’s text.</li>
	<li>Livingstone sought to counter the saturation damage by reinking some of the most smeared text first with iron gall ink, then, at a point after early April 1871, Zingifure ink.</li>
	<li>Concurrently with reinking and revising portions of the diary in Zingifure ink, Livingstone also wrote a full page of the diary (1870h:XX) in this ink.</li>
</ul>

The processing dramatically reveals Livingstone\'s reinking, at a later date, of one of the most smeared words on the page. </span></p>

<p class="space-1">1873-1874</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:1.5em;">
	<li>The diary received additional damage, including additional saturation from a circular object being set on one of its pages&nbsp;(1870i:XXXV-XXXVI) and the puncturing of a sequence of pages with a sharp or blunt object (1870i:XXXV-LV [v.2]). These event may or may not have a connection with the other major instance of page saturation cited above, but Livingstone did not attempt to remedy this damage either by reinking or by repairing the pierced pages, and so the damage may have occurred after his death in April 1873.</li>
	<li>One or more additional substances were spilled on the pages of the diary, now falling on top of Livingstone’s handwritten text so as to smear or otherwise obscure that text. Livingstone did not attempt to remedy this damage either so it too may have occurred after his death in April 1873.</li>
	<li>The edges of a few pages of the 1870 Field Diary (1870k:LXXIV, LXXV) were torn off, taking Livingstone writing with them. Again, Livingstone did not restore this writing, so this damage too may have occurred after his death.</li>
	<li>As the manuscript of the 1870 Field Diary aged and circulated through various kinds of environments, its pages started to become discolored in various places.</li>
	<li>The manuscript of 1870 Field Diary accompanied Livingstone’s body and some of his other final field diaries (including the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>) from central Africa to Britain.</li>
	<li>Once in Britain, the 1870 Field Diary along with other diaries and journals from Livingstone final expedition to Africa became the basis for the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874) edited by Horace Waller. Agnes Livingstone transcribed the 1870 Field Diary manuscript as part of this process.</li>
</ul>

<p class="space-1">1874-1965</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:1.5em;">
	<li>Different branches of the Livingstone family took possession of different portions of the 1870 Field Diary manuscript.</li>
	<li>Sections of the manuscript passed from the Livingstone family to the David Livingstone Centre (circa late 1920s-late 1940s), the British Library (1960), and the National Library of Scotland (1965).</li>
	<li>Archivists and others at the three repositories added a few annotations, a shelfmark, and archival page numbers to the manuscript’s leaves.</li>

	<li>The three repositories, in various forms, arranged for the diary’s conservation. The conservation work included flattening out some of the diary’s leaves and, in some cases, laminating them. Stirling University carried out the conservation work on the David Livingstone Centre pages between March 1986 and May 1987.</li>
</ul>

<p class="space-1">2009-2017</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:1.5em;">
	<li>In 2009, the David Livingstone Centre’s archivist Anne Martin rediscovered the Centre’s segments of the 1870 Field Diary while following up on a research query from Adrian S. Wisnicki.</li>
	<li>In 2010, the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project arranged for further conservation of the David Livingstone Centre leaves of the diary (particularly so that the most fragile bits could be stabilized), then spectrally imaged all of the diary except for the four pages held by the British Library. These spectral images form the basis of the present critical edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>The present critical edition (2017), therefore, represents the last step in this historical sequence. The edition adds one final repository to the list, <em>Livingstone Online</em>, and brings together all the surviving the pages of the diary for the first time in over a hundred years.</p>

<p>Many nineteenth-century explorers were celebrities. Whether this fame came from their accomplishments in geography, science, or missionary work, explorers such as Livingstone were often hailed as heroes. Often without regard to the work produced by the explorers themselves, a host of Victorian myth-makers made it their business to profit from turning individual explorers into heroes or villains. Often, the explorer’s reputation would be well established before the adventurer had even returned from the field.</p>

<p>Print was crucial to this endeavour. By the mid-nineteenth century the trade in newspapers, magazines, journals, books and so on had expanded to such a degree that it was possible to reach the masses for the first time. Publications tailored their contents for their intended readers, each contributing information about the latest expeditionary ventures in highly specific ways intended to generate more interest in these explorers - and their publications.</p>

<p>However, the importance of print in constructing an explorer\'s legacy did not fade with the traveler\'s return home. Rather, print raised expectations about the successes or failures that would result from particular ventures, and it was thus necessary for explorers to confirm or contradict the reports produced in their absence. The expeditionary narrative was the main means of doing so and was presented as the explorer\'s eyewitness account of things that the general public could not hope to encounter for themselves.</p>

<p>These exploration narratives were then subjected to intense scrutiny by a whole range of readers, each with their own specific expectations. Publishers, editors and explorer-authors prepared their narratives with this in mind, attempting to make exploration accounts as widely acceptable and saleable as possible. By acting as intermediates between authors and the reading public, members of the book trade played a significant role in shaping the myths that developed around individual explorers. Moreover, their influence reached beyond their contemporary settings with future generations of readers, and biographers in particular, often relying heavily upon such volumes for knowledge of those who dominated European accounts of nineteenth-century exploration.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s fame and the myths surrounding him owe much to Henry Morton Stanley\'s “discovery” of him and also the manner of his demise. Long before these events, however, Livingstone\'s first published narrative was one of the nineteenth century\'s bestselling books. <em>Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</em> (Livingstone 1857r) created Livingstone\'s reputation as a heroic explorer who made contributions to geography, medicine and science, the abolition of the slave trade, and missionary endeavours as well as a whole range of other causes.</p>

<p>The success of this work did not merely help to establish Livingstone in the public eye; it also firmly cemented John Murray\'s reputation as one of the foremost publishers of geographical works in the period. As John Murray’s role in <em>Missionary Travels </em>exemplifies, print and publishers helped create the cult of celebrity surrounding nineteenth-century exploration.</p>

<p>Livingstone received an invitation to publish a volume on his travels even before he had returned from Africa. The President of the Royal Geographical Society, Roderick Murchison, wrote to the explorer in May 1856 explaining that John Murray - one of the best known geographical publishers of the day - was eager for Livingstone to put together a book based upon his experiences in Africa. Three weeks after Livingstone returned to England, Murray iterated his desire to put Livingstone into print, making a formal proposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Murray was so anxious to secure Livingstone’s book, he offered unusually generous terms. Writing on 5 January 1857, Murray noted that although it was standard practice to divide any profit equally, he offered in this instance to undertake the entire cost of publication, including the engraving of illustrations and maps, in return for only one-third of the profits (Murray 1857a).</p>

<p>In this exchange, Murray presented himself as a kind of agent operating on the explorer\'s behalf, playing up the personal satisfaction that he would gain from working with Livingstone whilst playing down the great financial reward such a contract might bring the publisher. Murray was, of course, well aware of the potential market that was already developing for Livingstone\'s text owing in no small degree to the efforts of Roderick Murchison, who did all he could to ensure that the explorer remained in the spotlight.</p>

<p>Murray wrote to Livingstone again a fortnight later, on 19 January 1857, in order to reiterate his offer (Murray 1857b). He appealed both to his personal interest in Livingstone\'s work and to his firm\'s reputation in order to persuade Livingstone to ignore the increasing interest shown by rival publishing houses. By way of incentive, Murray offered Livingstone a two thousand guinea advance on his share of the profits and also noted that the firm would be on hand to provide "literary assistance," an indication perhaps that Murray was all too aware that explorers were rarely naturally gifted writers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, Livingstone had privately expressed doubts about his ability to compile a publishable narrative. Nevertheless he accepted Murray\'s offer and began transforming his field diaries into a manuscript for public consumption. In constructing the manuscript for <em>Missionary Travels</em> Livingstone not only transferred information but also, crucially, transformed that information in an acknowledgement that the rules governing what were recorded in the pages of a field diary were different to those guiding what was appropriate in the pages of a published account.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s correspondence with Murray suggests that he was aware of the need to cater his text to the demands of his likely audience, making reference, for instance, to appeasing religious readers and, as he wrote in 1857, providing something to interest "the scientific" as well as ensuring that he did not offend "the sensitive" (Livingstone 1857f; Livingstone 1857n). Thus the manuscript ultimately presented to Murray was the result of negotiation, as Livingstone attempted to make a case for further involvement in Africa in such a way that would ensure maximum impact with minimum offence.</p>

<p>Murray’s influence on <em>Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</em> is evident from the very beginning. The book begins with a "personal sketch" of the author which was included, so it said, at the request of several of Livingstone\'s most trusted friends. While Murray is not explicitly acknowledged, correspondence reveals that he was indeed one of those friends. In a letter dated May 1857, for instance, Livingstone revealed that he had taken the advice of Murray and one of his employees, Mr. Binney, and included in the personal sketch information designed to ensure that the book would appeal to both an "intellectual" and a "religious" public (Livingstone 1857f). Livingstone\'s background, in particular, presented the explorer as a “man of the people”: honest, hardworking, self-educated and, although religious, not overzealous.</p>

<p>However, the interventions of Murray and his employees were rarely received on such good terms. Despite Livingstone\'s assertion that Murray would not find him "cantankerous or difficult to deal with," Livingstone regularly wrote to express his dissatisfaction at the "liberties" being taken with his manuscript (Livingstone 1857f). Much of his annoyance was directed towards the reviser Milton. Livingstone was clear in his mind that this individual was thoroughly unqualified to judge the merits of a book of this sort, and argued that the "namby-pambyism" that had "diluted" and "emasculated" the text would inflict considerable harm to the cause which the text was intended to support (Livingstone 1857d; Livingstone 1857e).</p>

<p>It was not simply the narrative which Livingstone was eager to defend. Livingstone had drawn inspiration from the recently published <em>Arctic Explorations</em> (1856) of Elisha Kent Kane and sought to replicate his style in his own writing. Livingstone appeared proud of the result, recalling the reactions of learned men such as Richard Owen and Roderick Murchison as well as Murray\'s own employees, Whitwell Elwin and Binney (Livingstone 1857c).</p>

<p>Thus, when the reviser sought to alter stylistic elements of Livingstone\'s writing his reaction was predictable. Despite Livingstone\'s belief that the style he had adopted would make the book popular, what he actually meant was that the style adopted would make the book popular with a particular kind of audience. He complained, for instance, on 31 May 1857 that the reviser\'s interference would result in a text that would be "quite abominable," fearing that it would resemble a "penny primer" in character.</p>

<p>This highlights both Livingstone\'s fear that the book might simply be seen as an entertaining read and his desire to salvage the scientific and intellectual, not to mention moral, basis of the text. He was adamant, for instance, that that "[m]any of the corrections already put in are not given in Kane\'s and my book will be read by person\'s in much the same position as to intelligence as the readers of his" (Livingstone 1857f)<sup>. </sup>Livingstone\'s desire to distinguish his text from the “penny primer” genre is perhaps also shown by his gentle prodding of Murray as to whether or not an additional, more expensive edition of the text should also be published.</p>

<p>Whilst undertaking a series of public engagements during July 1857, Livingstone had received an enquiry as to the possibility of purchasing such a volume. Although he replied to the interested party that the matter would be left in the hands of Murray, Livingstone clearly believed that there would be a market for such an edition. His retelling of the event in his letter of 11 July 1857 saw Livingstone play the role of ignorant author seeking the expert guidance of his publisher - a marked contrast to his other letters demanding that Murray sack his literary advisor (Livingstone 1857h).</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s anxieties over the manuscript may be ascribed to the intense scrutiny he predicted it would receive (Livingstone 1857c). He recorded that he was "somewhat anxious lest anything should not be exactly true or rather just my way of saying them should convey ought but the real veritable idea I have of them” (Livingstone 1857g). Livingstone knew that once the text became public property it would be he, not Murray, the reviser or any other Murray employee that would be called to account for its contents.</p>

<p>Pre-empting Murray\'s dismissal of the reviser, Livingstone informed his publisher that he would consult Francis Galton and Royal Geographical Society Secretary Norton Shaw as to the possibility of them casting an eye over his manuscript. Norton Shaw\'s agreement to do so involved another prominent geographer in the construction of <em>Missionary Travels</em>.</p>

<p>Although authorship would be attributed to Livingstone alone, the authority of the volume would be achieved by packaging the narrative alongside a number of other literary and illustrative devices to form the completed book. The appendix included with the first edition was, like the narrative, something of a collaborative effort, for example. The calculations behind the four pages of tables showing "latitude and longitude of positions" were completed by Thomas Maclear, Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope, using Livingstone\'s observation book, which Livingstone confessed to Murray and Captain Henry Toynbee was "quite a mass of confusion" (Livingstone 1857n; Livingstone 1857m).<sup> </sup>Livingstone was eager to include this appendix on the grounds that it would "lend interest to the book among the scientific" - again pointing to the fact that Livingstone purposefully attempted to construct his book so as to attract specific audiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is interesting, however, that Livingstone discussed the matter with Maclear, Murchison, the cartographer John Arrowsmith and Toynbee before Murray (Livingstone 1857k). Indeed, having obtained their assurances that the observations were worthy of publication, he was, as he told Toynbee, reluctant to accept Murray\'s assessment that "the majority of readers care little for these details" (Livingstone 1857l). Livingstone appeared to be in a quandary, unsure whether to trust his own instincts as to the interest his observations were likely to attract or to follow his publisher\'s advice for, as he told Toynbee, "12,000 is a series [sic] expense though it would only be two sheets" (Livingstone 1857l).</p>

<p>In the end Murray and Toynbee together provided a solution. <em>Missionary Travels</em> would carry only a table of longitude and latitude whilst fuller discussion of the observations made during his journeys would be published in the <em>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</em> (Livingstone 1857o). In this instance then, Murray was only one of a number of individuals who had a hand in the way that this element of the book was presented to the public.</p>

<p>While ultimate control rested with Murray, who succeeded in convincing Livingstone that 12,000 copies of his observations were an unnecessary expense, it is clear that Livingstone felt it necessary to canvas a range of opinions before backing down. Thus, in the case of the appendix, as with the narrative itself, the authority of both the author and the publisher over the construction of the book was constantly being renegotiated.</p>

<p>While Livingstone felt that the inclusion of the appendix was crucial to establishing the scientific merit of the volume, a number of other elements contributed to this effect. The dedication to Murchison, for example, enabled Livingstone to publicly make a claim about his character, his professional ability, and the value of his text while, at the same time, appearing humble. By thanking Murchison for "the kind interest he has always taken in the Author\'s pursuits and welfare," Livingstone publicly advertised the fact that his acquaintance with Murchison was not purely professional.</p>

<p>The logic was simple; if Murchison found Livingstone to be of sound character then so too should the reader. Yet Livingstone also emphasised Murchison\'s "eminent scientific attainments," instructing Murray to ensure that Murchison\'s titles were placed correctly on the appropriate page, not simply to establish the professional capabilities of his associate, but also as a means of highlighting that those attainments were "verified three years afterwards by the Author of these Travels" which in turn suggested that Livingstone\'s own work was equally valuable (Livingstone 1857p). Livingstone originally discussed the idea of a "double dedication" addressed to both Murchison and Maclear but was dissuaded by the lack of a precedent, serving to highlight that the inclusion of the dedication in the volume as it appeared, showed his awareness of conventions of the genre (Livingstone 1857j).</p>

<p>It was not only the production of different textual features which attracted many hands, however. As was usual for an exploration account published by Murray, <em>Missionary Travels</em> contained several illustrations. A number of parallels can be drawn between the construction of Livingstone\'s narrative and that of the images placed alongside it. Neither reflected a straight-forward eyewitness recollection of the events that unfolded while Livingstone was in Africa, and often they are in tension with one another.</p>

<p>Just as the narrative went through a number of stages — from field diary to manuscript to corrected manuscript and so on, the illustrations underwent a similar process of transformation. Technology at the time was such that pencil sketches were transferred onto woodblocks by an artist and then professional engravers completed the process producing an image fit for publication. However, whereas explorers usually returned from the field laden with sketches, Livingstone readily admitted his inadequacy in this department.</p>

<p>One of the few sketches that Livingstone did return with formed the basis of the frontispiece showing the Victoria Falls. However, Livingstone noted in the text that "The artist has a good idea of the scene, but, by way of explanation, he has shown more of the depth of the fissure than is visible, except by going close to the edge." In this instance, then, Livingstone sought to retain control over the information communicated by the image by using the text.</p>

<p>The rest of the illustrations that made it into the published volume - there were 47 in all including the frontispiece, portrait and two maps - then had to be sourced from a variety of locations.</p>

<p>As the preface revealed, the frontispiece sketch was complemented by those provided by Captain Henry Need and the artist Joseph Wolf, the latter of which were drawn from descriptions provided by Major Frank Vardon and William Cotton Oswell as well as those of Livingstone himself. However, Livingstone admitted that he had struggled to make sense of things visually, being frequently unable to judge distances by sight alone. Such shortcomings made for a difficult working relationship with Wolf. Livingstone\'s inability to communicate his desires led to his intense dissatisfaction with a number of the images supplied for the book (Livingstone 1857s).</p>

<p>The most famous of these was that of "The missionary\'s escape from the lion" which Livingstone described as "abominable," complaining that "[e]very one who knows what a lion is will die with laughing at it" (Livingstone 1857b). For the majority of readers, however, the opportunity did not exist to verify the reality behind these representations, and Murray was very willing to publish these illustrations in spite of their inaccuracies. For those readers that may have only looked at the pictures in the book, missing out on Livingstone\'s frequent attempts to control how they were interpreted through comments in the text, these illustrations <em>were</em> Livingstone\'s <em>Missionary Travels</em>; they <em>were</em> Africa.</p>

<p>Until the book left the publishing house it could have little impact upon public impressions of Africa. Again a number of individuals were involved in circulating the book, further challenging the assertion that <em>Missionary Travels</em> was the product of a single hand. Although Murray, as publisher, had chief responsibility for ensuring that the distribution and sale of the book was as extensive as possible, his job was made much easier by the interventions of Murchison, who saw to it that there was a captive audience waiting to receive Livingstone\'s text even before the manuscript was complete, a fact which Livingstone himself was well aware of (Livingstone 1857c).</p>

<p>It was not only Murchison, however, who had raised expectations. Livingstone had intended to remain in England for a few months only and thus Murray expected the book to be ready by Easter. Delays, however, meant that by 27 March Livingstone\'s manuscript was far from complete (Livingstone 1857a). This though, had not prevented Murray from advertising the book\'s imminent publication in <em>The Times</em> only a few days earlier. Murray also announced that Livingstone\'s <em>Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</em> would be the only official account of his work in Africa, encouraging the public to hold out for Murray\'s publication since it was the only book authored and thus authorised by Livingstone himself.</p>

<p>Both Livingstone and Murray were becoming increasingly frustrated by attempts both within and beyond Britain to produce rival volumes. Each of these piracies claimed to be the product of Livingstone\'s hand or to have his full consent although these claims could not have been further from the truth. Both men worried that these projected publications would undermine the popularity of <em>Missionary Travels</em> when it was finally published and that they would also result in inaccurate claims about Africa being wrongly attributed to Livingstone. They were so worried about such eventualities that they went to lengths to dissuade the public from taking these works seriously, utilising letters columns, book adverts and even the space of the finished published volume itself to draw attention to the wrongdoings of less respectable publishing houses.</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, however, Murchison and Murray\'s attempts to create a market for the book appear to have worked to tremendous effect, earning Livingstone a significant sum in the process. The first edition of 12,000 copies sold out immediately despite its price tag of one guinea. To cope with the demand, Murray ordered the printing of another 8,000 copies of the 689 page volume. By the beginning of December this run too had sold out and Murray sent another 5,000 to the presses (Livingstone 1857q). He announced the fact that 25,000 copies in all had now been printed in the 12 December edition of <em>Notes and Queries,</em> informing its readers that "a fresh delivery of this work will be ready next week, when Copies may be obtained of every Bookseller in Town or Country."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such adverts not only let potential customers know that the book would soon be available again but were also a means of telling people that it was a very successful book, one that was in high demand, one which should be read. A letter in which Livingstone relayed the tale of a friend in Manchester who only obtained the book after "offering 2/6 to any boy who would procure it for him" compliments these kinds of adverts and gives greater insight into the market for <em>Missionary Travels</em> (Livingstone 1857q).</p>

<p>The tremendous success enjoyed by this volume perhaps explains why Murray waited until 1861 to publish <em>A Popular Account of Missionary Travels in South Africa</em> even though Livingstone had authorised the production of an abridged volume only three months after the first edition appeared. With a full-length volume selling so well there appears to have been little economic incentive to produce a cheaper edition straight away. Indeed one of Murray\'s Copies Ledgers reveals that the firm had another run of 5,000 copies of the initial work printed in March 1858 followed by another thousand which included an index, just a month after Livingstone authorised the abridgement.</p>

<p>Furthermore Livingstone had left the matter entirely in Murray\'s hands effectively giving him free reign to construct and market the shorter publication as and when he saw fit (Livingstone 1858). Whitwell Elwin was selected to compile the abridgement. He had experience of both authorship and editorship particularly through his post as editor of the <em>Quarterly Review</em> between 1853 and 1860. Elwin had also been involved in the production of the original <em>Missionary Travels</em> offering Livingstone guidance on his manuscript making him well placed to undertake the task of cutting the original text.</p>

<p>And cut he did, reducing the text from 687 pages to 435. It was not only the text that changed, however. Various textual devices that Murray had moulded for the first book were also altered. The title page for instance contained notable differences. Beyond the fact that the title was now <em>A Popular Account of Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa,</em> Livingstone\'s professional associations were replaced simply with M.D. Moreover, the illustration of the tsetse fly which had been included in the first volume on Livingstone\'s insistence was replaced with the altogether more friendly looking female hippopotamus and her calf. Additionally, the volume now came "with map and illustrations," as opposed to "with portrait, maps by Arrowsmith, and numerous illustrations." Furthermore, the dedication and preface were removed so that the reader proceeded directly to the contents page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, whereas the original volume utilised the space of the book prior to the beginning of the narrative to establish Livingstone\'s status as an authoritative speaker on Africa through his association with various learned societies and individuals, Elwin and Murray evidently regarded such steps as unnecessary in the <em>Popular Account.</em> This demonstrates how publishers considered that it was not simply the narrative that needed to be altered to make a book appropriate for a “general” or non-scientific audience.</p>

<p>The popular account retained the majority of images that had been included in the original full-length work, yet there were some notable omissions including the author\'s portrait. By 1861 the attention that Livingstone had received was such that it was no longer necessary to introduce the public to Livingstone in the same way that it had been in 1857. Arrowsmith\'s detailed map and the tables of longitude and latitude which Livingstone had championed first time round were also discarded, highlighting how Murray had a much more freedom to construct the <em>Popular Account</em> with Livingstone out of the way.</p>

<p>Murray did not only remove elements that had appeared in the full-length editions, however. He also added features to the text, suggesting that although economic motives most likely guided a number of the decisions taken about this work - the abridgement cost considerably less to publish, and subsequently retailed at only six shillings - they were not the only considerations that came into play, suggesting that a “popular” edition did not necessarily have to be cheap in Murray\'s eyes.</p>

<p>Murray\'s inclusion, for instance, of the an extract from the journal of Captain Hyde Parker as an appendix was an additional expense that did not appear in Murray\'s original estimate of the cost. However, included as it was, it provided information to the reader about the potential for European settlement around the Zambezi that could either be read in addition to the condensed narrative or by itself.</p>

<p>Another inclusion that did not appear in the initial print runs of <em>Missionary Travels</em> was the index. This encouraged the reader to utilise the book as a reference text, rather than necessarily reading it from cover to cover. Interestingly, in light of the distinctions that appeared to be drawn between scientific and “general” audiences, the index specifically included a section entitled “Scientific names of plants and animals noticed in the foregoing work,” which perhaps reveals that this distinction was not as clear cut as it may first appear. Despite the ongoing success of the original version of <em>Missionary Travels</em> and the appearance of various pirated editions attempting to pre-empt the release of an official popular version, Murray still managed to attract a market for the <em>Popular Account</em>, selling in excess of 10,000 copies.</p>

<p>Although sales figures themselves reveal much about the publishing sensation surrounding <em>Missionary Travels</em>, they do not provide insights into how readers experienced Livingstone\'s text. Periodical reviews can give a richer understanding of how different people encountered the book, as well as the discussions which dominate the Livingstone-Murray correspondence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, the personal sketch included at the beginning of the narrative at the request of Murray came to bear directly upon many reviewers\' assessments of Livingstone\'s writing style. Some reviewers explicitly equated his plain, simple and trustworthy character with a plain, simple and trustworthy narrative. However, Livingstone\'s style was, of course, one of the elements that he had discussed with Murray and consciously worked at in order to make his book "popular" and "saleable" (Livingstone 1857d; Livingstone 1857e; Livingstone 1857f). His attempts to replicate Kane\'s style in<em> Arctic Explorations</em> reaped rewards, with some reviewers explicitly drawing parallels between the two authors. Livingstone\'s success in this regard was two-fold, with reviewers not only making the desired connection, but also doing so without apparently realising that Livingstone had attempted to engineer this.</p>

<p>Many reviewers were happy to excuse the “unworked” nature of Livingstone\'s text on the grounds that he was a missionary traveller by trade and could not be expected to excel in literary endeavours. The attractiveness, or otherwise, of Livingstone\'s style had much to do with the particular persuasion of the reader though. <em>The Ladies\' Repository,</em> for example, preferred Livingstone\'s narrative to that of the German explorer Heinrich Barth on account of its "romantic attraction" and asserted that although it was educational, it could also be devoured for "literary enjoyment." The <em>Athenaeum</em> echoed this assertion noting, the text\'s poetic character.</p>

<p>However, Margaret Oliphant\'s review for <em>Blackwood\'s Magazine</em> was less generous, claiming that "it is to the credit of this generation, which loves \'style\' so much, and is greatly influenced by literary graces, that a work so entirely devoid of both should, nevertheless have attained so remarkable a popularity." Indeed, as Pettit explains, the more “serious” British periodicals sometimes took Livingstone\'s crudeness of style as evidence of a lack of breeding and scientific training; an assertion which the personal sketch could be said to prove.</p>

<p>The personal sketch was also utilised to different ends in discussions of Livingstone\'s credentials as a missionary. Catholic publications seemingly struggled to assess <em>Missionary Travels</em> for fear of praising protestant missionary activity. However, after highlighting the fact that Livingstone\'s "antecedents were Hebridian Catholics in one or two removes" it became easier for some to praise his work.</p>

<p>However, while his lack of "professional and pietistic whinings" were admired in some quarters, others read this as evidence of his lack of commitment to missionary endeavours.<sup> </sup>The <em>Dublin Review, </em>for instance commented that "no one in reading his account of himself could say that missionary labours were his principal occupation." This in itself, however, did not worry the reviewer to any great degree, who was firm in his conviction that "[w]e are more than reconciled to what so many have objected to — the title of \'Missionary Travels,\' prefixed to the work."</p>

<p>Although intended to praise the book, such comments also alerted the reader to the fact that its reception as a book had been problematic. Even through an initial examination of the reception of the personal sketch and Livingstone\'s style it quickly becomes clear that the author and publisher had some degree of success in shaping the way that readers responded. However, it is also evident that readers did not respond uniformly.</p>

<p>Although the initial edition of <em>Missionary Travels</em> attracted much attention, the market for the abridgement was created largely without the help of the reviewing periodicals. Although a few publications, mainly of religious persuasion, carried notices heralding the release of the abridgement, generally it excited little interest among the reviewing community suggesting that despite the significant reworking and repackaging of the volume by Murray and Elwin, the work was held to offer little that had not already been provided for the reader.</p>

<p>Of course, this in many ways reflects the fact that reviewing publications were so often targeted at those classes who did not need to wait for a 6 shilling volume to emerge. Even those publications that explicitly targeted less affluent readers often felt it necessary simply to announce that a less expensive edition was now available for purchase without elaborating any further upon the work\'s content.</p>

<p>Examining these reviews alongside the printed volumes and pre-publication correspondence provides insights into <em>Missionary Travels</em> that cannot be gained from examining the published works alone. Taken together, these sources highlight the many individuals that came together, at times uneasily, to produce Livingstone\'s most famous work and complicate simple understandings of single authorship. Moreover, the sources reveal the many lives that <em>Missionary Travels</em> had – as authorised scientific volume, popular work, and religious document – as well as its afterlives: in advertisements and sales, and in building both John Murray and Livingstone’s reputations in and beyond the nineteenth century.</p>

Often such information cannot be found elsewhere. Historian Roy C. Bridges (1981:202) notes that Livingstone “is the principal and sometimes the only source of information on certain areas of Africa in certain periods.”</p>

<p>Livingstone’s letters and other manuscripts also provide an exemplary case of how scientific and political networks across the Victorian globe were set up. Livingstone, both when abroad and at home, mobilized domestic and foreign resources to create a career mostly spent 5,000 miles from Britain. Livingstone’s correspondence reveals the practicalities of how empires are created and managed.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s three long-term visits to Africa (1841-56, 1858-63, 1866-73) took him through the countries that today constitute South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He became the first European to make contact with a range of previously “unknown” African tribes, to cross Africa from coast to coast, and to describe and name Victoria Falls and many other interior geographical features.</p>

<p>Consequently, Livingstone’s manuscripts are an exceptional primary resource for a range of disciplines. In recent decades, for instance, scholars have drawn on Livingstone’s primary texts and manuscripts to study a broad range of topics, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the impact of missionary activity in Malawi (McCracken 1977)</li>
	<li>the origins of South African apartheid ideology (Du Toit 1983)</li>
	<li>fungi in tropical Africa (Piearce 1985)</li>
	<li>the role of slavery in Zanzibar’s East African commercial empire (Sheriff 1987)</li>
	<li>collaborative editing practices in the Victorian publishing industry (Helly 1987)</li>
	<li>local trade along the Botletli River in Botswana (Cashdan 1987)</li>
	<li>the prevalence of malnutrition in precolonial Africa (Rijpma 1996)</li>
	<li>the contribution of non-Western populations to Victorian geographical discourse (Bridges 1998)</li>
	<li>climactic variability in southern Africa during the nineteenth century (Endfield and Nash 2002)</li>
	<li>state building in south central Africa (Flint 2003)</li>
	<li>the ophthalmological consequences of exposure to tropical environments (Larner 2004)</li>
	<li>the role of travel in the construction of nineteenth-century scientific knowledge (Dritsas 2005)</li>
	<li>the development of Victorian travel book illustrations (Koivunen 2009)</li>
	<li>East African urbanization and Central African village market economy (Wisnicki 2011)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The scope of these studies testifies to the range of unique information available in Livingstone’s texts.</p>

<p>Access to the manuscripts – only a small percentage of which had been edited to modern standards and published prior to the inception of <em>Livingstone Online</em> in 2004 – can expand our understanding of the production of both nineteenth-century scientific knowledge and nineteenth-century African and British imperial history. The manuscripts also illuminate broader nineteenth-century Anglophone strategies for representing foreign peoples, cultures, and practices. Far from being relics of the past, these strategies continue to influence how Western culture represents people around the world.</p>

Often they produced these records in stages, with each successive record building on and revising the information contained in previous records. Roy C. Bridges (1987:180) has identified three general categories of such records: “There is the first-stage or ‘raw’ record made as [the explorer] went along, the more considered and organised journal or perhaps letter written during intervals of greater leisure and finally the definitive account of the expedition, usually composed after his return to Europe with a view to publication.” However, adds Bridges, “these categories are not of course absolute and in practice may merge into one another in various ways.” (For more on the critical debate, see Youngs 1994 and Wisnicki 2010.)</p>

<p>Livingstone didn’t live to publish “the definitive account” of his final travels. Rather, Horace Waller posthumously edited and published the <em>Last Journals</em> in 1874 (see Helly 1987; also see <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript">The Manuscript</a>). However, Bridges’s categories otherwise offer a useful method for grouping the documents Livingstone produced on his last journey. These documents include first-stage records such as field diaries and notebooks, and second-stage records such as letters and the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) into which Livingstone transcribed most of his field diaries. Bridges (1987:181, 184) underscores the value of the “raw,” unadulterated, first-stage records: “Direct and full information on the journey is provided with no later glossing, omission or addition”; as a result, “Livingstone’s notebooks and diaries do sometimes give information which is simply not present at all in published works.”</p>

<p>Reference to the texts made available in this edition – the 1871 Field Diary and the corresponding portions of the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874), and a&nbsp;passage in an 1871 letter to Earl Granville (1872d; included here as a <a href="/spectral-imaging/third-massacre-narrative">“bonus” text</a>) – illustrates Bridges’s arguments. Dorothy Helly (1987) has definitively described the range of editorial moves by which Waller transformed the Unyanyembe Journal into the published <em>Last Journals</em> and so helped create the Livingstone we remember today. However, a look at the newly-revealed text of the 1871 Field Diary shows that the distance between this work and the Unyanyembe Journal – let alone the published <em>Last Journals</em> – is much greater than that between the latter two texts.</p>

<p>The 1871 Field Diary offers a candid, unmediated, and often unnarrativized window onto Livingstone’s experiences in the field. The diary reads as much as a Victorian work as it does a fragmentary, modernist record of travel in extreme circumstances. At times the writing is disorganized, at times incoherent, at times Livingstone cycles through a heterogeneous range of narrative modes – offering descriptions of experiences, meteorological observations, native vocabularies, field notes, and drafts of letters in rapid succession. Moreover, the opportunity to read the text of the diary while viewing the images of the manuscript pages – whether natural light or processed spectral images – reveals the intimate link between what Livingstone writes and the way his words appear on the page, for instance, when the particularly heavy blotting of his ink follows a passage where Livingstone notes: “We have rain in large quantity almost every night” (1871f:CVII).</p>

<p>The diary also shows Livingstone at a moment of crisis, in circumstances that often get the better of him and lead him into decisions that he would otherwise not make. As a result, when we read the 1871 Field Diary alongside the 1871 letter to Earl Granville and the corresponding segment of the Unyanyembe Journal, we get a fascinating glimpse into the way Livingstone hoped to rewrite problematic incidents and (re)present himself to the public.</p>

<p>In Field Diary VI, Livingstone travels through the Zalamyama Mountains and then across the Loangwa River valley. Throughout, he records the threat of violence from the Mazitu people, an African ethnic group descended from the Nguni of kwaZulu-Natal who migrated north due to the Mfecane of the early nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The diary opens with two large villages in flight from the Mazitu. Later, Livingstone notes that this threat has hampered others\' prosperity, that the "country in a poor state for the Mazitu have no check &amp; come every now &amp; then &amp; strip people of all their food" (Livingstone 1866e:[14]). This threat causes Livingstone to change his route, as he cannot travel through the famine-stricken regions. Later, he finds hidden food stores, unmarked to protect them from Mazitu raids, in the forests by the Loangwa river (Livingstone 1866e:[82]).</p>

<p>As in many of the previous diaries, Livingstone continues to comment on local customs of dress and personal decoration and includes many drawings of facial features and tattoos. As he travels, Livingstone finds numerous thriving iron forges. He also makes observations on the local means of communication, such the meanings of various hand-claps. The people of the region proves extremely hospitable. One promises to "see that he [Livingstone] has carriers quite early tomorrow morning who will hand him safely into Kanyindula\'s care &amp; say to Kanyindula that he is expected to perform all the duties to a stranger" (Livingstone 1866e:[28]).</p>

<p>More than in previous diaries, Livingstone develops comparisons between Africa and Scotland, arguing, for instance, that "These people are not like our dangerous classes who borrow from civilization little but the art of masking evil &amp; of converting knowledge into cunning" (Livingstone 1866e:[92]). Livingstone also includes a lengthy discourse on the history of Scotland, presumably in comparison to Africa, as a land that was kept in the "rearward of civilization" by fighting until the twelfth or thirteenth centuries (1866e:[101]). But, he concludes, by becoming "the apt pupil of more fortunate nations," Scotland grew in scholarship and industry (1866e:[100]).</p>

<p>During this portion of journey Livingstone rarely encounters slaves or slave traders, although he continues to ruminate on the slave trade. He notes that certain groups of Africans - the Zulus and Kaffirs - have no "idea of property in man that can be sold," but that Arabs do and so do the Manganja and Waiyau, groups whose links to slavery he discussed in previous diaries (Livingstone 1866e:[51]). In addition, Livingstone argues that these different values may also translate to political and cultural differences: "All the \'heavy hung\' Africans are slave dealers or vendors - the more moderate not" (Livingstone 1866e:[85]).</p>

<p>Additionally, Livingstone\'s interactions with Africans often grow out of the effects of the slave trade, as when he notes that two "smart young Waiyau men" joined his party. The employment of these men shows the mutable nature of "slave" and "free" status as they exist in Central Africa: "[The Waiyau men] were bought at Mbanga &amp; Mukate\'s by Babisa but the Mazitu killed all their Manganja masters &amp; now they are free so we engage them" (Livingstone 1866e:[66]).</p>

<p>As in previous diaries, Livingstone writes this diary from the front (daily diary entries) and back (random notes) at the same time, writing upside-down at the back of the book to differentiate the two types of writing. He writes primarily in grey pencil, with some additions in reddish-orange pencil and the occasional over-inking in black ink. The final section is used for maps of the mountain ranges and rivers he travels through, as well as temperature and distance calculations, and lists of local place names. This notebook also preserves more plant life than previous volumes with many pages bearing the imprints of flowers, twigs, and other such plant matter.</p>

The site draws on recent scholarship and international collaboration to restore one of the British Empire\'s most iconic figures to the many global contexts in which he worked, traveled, and is remembered.</p>

<p>Since 2004, <em>Livingstone Online</em> has established itself as a leading archival resource for the study of African history, nineteenth-century travel, and the British Empire. The site\'s <a href="/his-own-words/livingstone-online-digital-collection">digital collection</a> of high-resolution manuscript images and critically-edited transcriptions – 15,000 images and 700 transcriptions by late 2017 – is among the largest on the internet related to any single historical British visitor to Africa.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s <a href="/about-site/why-should-we-read-livingstone’s-manuscripts">manuscripts</a> encompass a wide <a href="/about-site/why-should-we-read-livingstone’s-manuscripts">range of topics</a> and hold educational value for diverse <a href="/about-site/who-livingstone-onlines-audience">audiences</a>. <em>Livingstone Online</em> unites these manuscripts – which otherwise hide from view in <a href="/his-own-words/repository">libraries and archives</a> around the world – for the first time ever.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> encourages study and discussion of Livingstone\'s ideas and key aspects of British imperial history through a site design that is simple and intuitive, yet also elegant and visually enriching. The site publishes <a href="/life-and-times">important research</a> on Livingstone\'s legacy and explores the many ways his ideas have circulated over time. By applying cutting-edge <a href="/spectral-imaging">spectral imaging technology</a>, the site open new frontiers in the study of nineteenth-century travel manuscripts.</p>

<p>Uniquely, <em>Livingstone Online</em> also takes visitors far <a href="/behind-the-scenes">behind the scenes</a> of its work – documenting <a href="/about-site/leap-2013-2017-project-history-part-i">step-by-step</a> the <a href="/behind-scenes/project-teams">international collaboration</a> among archives, scholars, scientists, librarians, computer programmers, and other specialists that has made the project possible. Collective projects such as <em>Livingstone Online</em> represent the present and the future of literary and historical studies online.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em>\'s goal is neither to praise nor condemn David Livingstone the individual. He was and remains a controversial figure. Rather, the site proceeds on the basis that Livingstone\'s varied and vast manuscript legacy offers an unparalleled window onto key aspects of nineteenth-century global history and intercultural encounter. This history is part of our shared cultural heritage and <a href="/about-site/theory-behind-livingstone-online">should be available</a> for detailed study.</p>

<p>Together, the many resources here bring David Livingstone’s world back to life for contemporary audiences in a comprehensive, complex, and critically-informed manner. The site invites visitors to browse its pages and encounter the history of the British Empire and nineteenth-century Africa in a new and unique way.</p>

<p>Data management is not meant to be unique; it is meant to be thorough and standardized. Prior to beginning work with Livingstone’s letter, data manager Doug Emery configured both the file system in which the information would be stored and the file naming system. To simplify retrieval of the information, Emery used a file naming system common to his previous projects, such as the <a href="http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/" target="_blank">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> and the <a href="http://www.digitalgalen.net/" target="_blank">Galen Syriac Palimpsest</a>.</p>

<p>Once the preparatory steps were complete and the imaging began, Emery worked to ensure uniform data storage and the practice of consistent management. As the images were captured, the camera produced DNG files, which were then flattened into TIFFs with data stored in the file headers. The data produced was itself stored on hard drives, which were switched out and duplicated as a preservation tactic.</p>

<p>The imaging team sought to capture ample information for Livingstone’s letter to Waller. Structural metadata, such as dimensions of the letters and information about the camera and lighting set-up, were recorded, along with descriptive metadata. The metadata collected conformed to internationally recognized standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/" target="_blank">Dublin Core</a> and <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284" target="_blank">OAIS</a> (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284" target="_blank">Open Archival Information System</a>). Finally, each image was linked to its metadata record in order to facilitate easy retrieval.</p>

<p>In Field Diary X, Livingstone finds himself hampered by local politics, ill health, and rain, as he travels westward to Lake Moero. The diary can be broken up roughly into two halves, each concerned with Livingstone\'s navigation of local conflicts between and among Africans and Arabs.</p>

<p>The first conflict lies in an argument between two chiefs, Hamees and Nsama, over marriage, slaves, and ivory. Livingstone is forced to appeal to both chiefs in order to continue his journey. Compounding the issue is that Livingstone feels obliged to travel with the better-equipped, more knowledgeable Arab traders, but finds travel with them slow and tedious, due to their pre-existing conflicts with local populations. Livingstone often records the difficulties this causes. For instance, one chief warns Livingstone that "the Arabs are not to come as we shall run away," a development that would prevent Livingstone and his men from procuring food (Livingstone 1867c:[36]).</p>

<p>As soon as Livingstone is able to move on from this conflict, however, he encounters another complex situation. Chief Cazembe rules his region with pomp and fear. Livingstone records his introduction to Cazembe on 4 November 1867 as a "grand reception" that involves music, rituals, ceremonial dress, and (as Livingstone terms him) a dwarf - the latter being the cause of Cazembe\'s sole smile (Livingstone 1867c:[3], [87]). Livingstone, in turn, gives Cazembe gifts and, "as it was explained that my goods were nearly done the present did not disappoint as it might have done from a trader" (Livingstone 1867c:[94]-[95]).</p>

<p>What follows, though, is a stalemate where Livingstone and his men are forced to remain in Cazembe\'s village for the next month and a half, stranded by Livingstone\'s illness and - similar to the previous situation - negotiations between Cazembe and Mohamad, an Arab trader. Mohamad mocks Cazembe and undermines his power; Cazembe responds by refusing to grant permission for the group to leave (Livingstone 1867c:[104]). Finally, on 22 December 1867, Livingstone and his men leave Cazembe, hoping to explore Lake Moero and then go on to Ujiji.</p>

This page present a full scene of village life whereas usually in his field diaries Livingstone confines himself to drawing only one or a few individuals at a time.</span></p>

<p>In addition to these political difficulties, Livingstone also suffers from incapacitating illnesses, primarily fever and the anal bleeding that would plague him for the rest of his life. In this field diary, there are several periods during December 1867 when Livingstone is prevented not only from travel but even from making the geographic and meteorological records that he typically records in detail. One challenge that does not present itself, however, is hunger, as the local headmen provide plentifully and Livingstone and his men eat heartily of palm oil, cassava, bananas, and ground nuts, in addition to enjoying gifts of beer, grain, and even a goat.</p>

<p>The diary itself takes the same form as <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-vii-overview">Field Diary VII</a>: a small brown book, bound at the top, with a tie to hold it together, manufactured by Lett\'s, Son, &amp; Co. The diary measures 140 mm high x 89mm wide x 16 mm thick. Almost every entry is written in grey pencil, with a few additions in red pencil, and the final two pages of the diary written first in pencil, then re-inscribed in black ink. Like his other field diaries, Livingstone writes from both sides at once, meeting at 1867c:[118].</p>

These two pages present an elaborate geographical illustration that combines a sketch with calculations and annotations.</span></p>

<p>Also as in previous diaries, the entries from the back are upside-down in relation to the ones from the front. The back entries at the back are also shorter and more time passes between individual entries. These shorter notes include rain tables, ideas for food preparation, place names, maps, geographic information, and speculation on rules of local succession of chiefs.</p>

<p>At times Livingstone expands in the end notes on the front part of the diary, as in the case of "a dwarf at Cazembes [sic]," where Livingstone notes that this person, who seems to be treated as a spectacle, is "3 ft 9 inches - His name Zofu of Charobansa" (Livingstone 1867c:[120]). At other times, the end notes have no corresponding reference in the first half of the diary, as when Livingstone writes that he had to "Dismiss James from being cook" (Livingstone 1867c:[128]), a point which Livingstone documents nowhere else in the diary.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em>\'s <a href="/his-own-words/livingstone-online-digital-collection">digital collection</a> includes a selection of images related to the aftermath of Livingstone\'s death in 1873. This bonus page provides a curated selection of these images. Some of the images appeared contemporaneously in the Victorian press; others emerged in subsequent years. The images focus on some of the individuals in Africa and Britain who took part in transporting Livingstone\'s body to its final resting place in Westminster Abbey and in mourning his death. As a result, the images restore some of the broader contexts in which Livingstone\'s legacy has resonated and highlight further cultural dimensions useful in the study of Livingstone\'s final manuscripts.</p>

<p>Our work on the critical editions of Livingstone’s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870</a> and <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871</a> Field Diaries and the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a> has resulted in a range of processed spectral images. Below, we enumerate the processed spectral image types, GIF animations, and PowerPoint presentations developed by our scientists (Roger Easton, Keith Knox, and Caroline Houston) in close collaboration with our scholars (Adrian S. Wisnicki, Megan Ward, Debbie Harrison, and Kate Simpson) to address our research goals. In a separate section of the site, we also out set out the objectives of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/prototyping-animated-spectral-images-asis">animated spectral images (ASIs)</a> developed by one of our junior project scholars (Ashanka Kumari).</p>

<p>For the second phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project (2013-17), we have repurposed a handful of processed images from the first phase (2010-13), as review showed that some images previously developed to recover faded text could also illuminate material history. These repurposed images are marked with two asterisks (**) in the list below. The other images from the first project phase are marked with a single asterisk (*). Images and other items not marked with any symbol are a direct result of the second project phase.</p>

<p>For each item, we provide 1) the short name by which we refer to the image type, animation, or presentation throughout our critical materials, 2) the original image name suffix (if available), which can contain unique processing information related to image creation, 3) a short description (provided by our scientists) of the underlying processing technique, 4) a list of material manuscript features for which the given image type proves particularly suited (images related to 1870 Field Diary only), and 5) the name of the scientist(s) who led the relevant spectral image processing.</p>

<p>For further analysis of the images and the implications for our understanding of the 1870 Field Diary manuscript, users should consult our six-part essay on <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">The State of the Manuscript</a>, especially parts <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1">III</a>, <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2">IV</a>, and <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3">V</a>.</p>

<p class="space2">The original version of this image differed considerably from the other processed images of this type. The gray values of the image were therefore rescaled. In other words, the initial rendering of the brightest and darkest pixels for the image relied on statistical metrics that set "white" at the 98th percentile and "black" at the 2nd percentile of the numerical values of the pixels over the entire scene. <a id="link43" name="link43"></a>In creating the rescaled version (the one used in this edition), therefore, we relied on the same calculations, but as applied over pixels only on the actual page of text, where the range of brightness values of pixels is smaller.</p>

<p class="space2">Unfortunately, the original spectral imaging of this page failed to produced one of the required raw spectral images (535nm, i.e., the fifth band). <a id="link44" name="link44"></a>As a result, during the present project we recreated this band by approximating it from the other available bands and, in turn, used this “synthetic” band in order to produce the other processed spectral images of this page.</p>

<p><a href="#link2.3">▲</a><strong>liv_000202_0004_color</strong></p>

<p class="space2">Due to a missing spectral band (see previous entry), the original version of this image differed considerably from the other processed images of this type. <a id="link45" name="link45"></a>We thus modified the original image in Abode Photoshop CC 2015.5 by using Auto Tone and adjustments to the Brightness/Contrast, Hue/Saturation, and Color Balance in order to produce the version of the image used in this critical edition.</p>

[…] Two days afterwards o[r] on the 15th of June a massacre was perpetrated which filled me with such intolerable loathing that I resolved to yield to the Banian slaves = return to Ujiji get men from the coast – and try to finish the rest of my work by going outside the area of Ujijian bloodshed instead of vainly trying from its interior outwards –</p>

<p>[576]<br />
Dugumbe and his people built their huts on the right bank of Lualaba at a market place called Nyangwe – On hearing that the head slave of a trader at Ujiji had in order to get canoes cheap, mixed blood with the headmen of the Bagenya on the left bank of the were disgusted with his assurance and resolved to punish him and make an impression in the country in favour of their own greatness by an assault on the market people, and on all the Bagenya who had dared to make friendship with any but themselves Tagamoio the principal undertrader of Dugumbe’s party was the perpetrator – The market was attended every fourth day by between 2000 and 3000 people – It was held on a long slope of land which down at the river ended in a creek capable of containing between fifty and sixty large canoes – The majority of the market people were women, many of them very pretty – The people west of the river brought fish salt pepper oil grass cloth iron fowls goats sheep pigs in great numbers to exchange with those East of the river for cassava, grain, potatoes and other farinaceous products – They have a strong sense of natural justice and all unite to force each other to fair dealing At first all were afraid of my presence but wishing to gain their confidence which my enemies tried to undermine or prevent, I went among them frequently and when they saw no harm in me became very gracious – The bargaining was the finest acting I ever saw I</p>

understood but few of the words that flew off their glib tongues of the women but their gestures spoke plainly – I took sketches of the fifteen varieties of fish brought in to compare them with those of the Nile lower down – and all were eager to tell their names but on the date referred to I had left the market only a minute or two when three men whom I had seen with guns and felt inclined to reprove them for bringing them into the market but had refrained by attributing it to ignorance in new comers – They began to fire into the dense crowd around them another party down at the canoes rained their balls on the panic struck multitude that rushed into these vessels – all threw away their goods the men forgot their paddles – The canoes were jammed in the creek and could not be got out quick enough – so many men &amp; women sprang into the water = The women of the left bank are expert divers for oysters = and a long line of heads shewed a crowd striking out for an island a mile off = To gain it they had to turn the left shoulder ^ \\against/ a current of between a mile and a half to two miles an hour = Had they gone diagonally with the current, though that would have been three miles, many would have gained the shore It was horrible to see one head after another disappear – Some calmly – others throwing their arms high up towards the Great Father and going down – some of the men who got canoes out of the crowd paddled quickly with hands and arms to help their friends Three took people in till they all sank together – one man had clearly lost his head for he paddled a canoe which</p>

would have held fifty people straight up stream = nowhere = The Arabs estimated the loss at between 400 &amp; 500 souls – Dugumbe sent out some of his men in one of thirty canoes which the owners ^ \\in their fright/ could not extricate to save the sinking – one lady refused to be taken on board because she thought that she was to be made a slave but he rescued twenty one and of his own accord sent them next day home Many escaped and came to me and were restored to their friends – When the firing began on the terror stricken crowd at the canoes – Tagamoio’s band began their assault on the people West of the river and continued the fire all day I counted seventeen villages in flames and next day six – Dugumbe’s power over the underlings is limited but he ordered them to cease shooting – those of Tagamoio’s party in the market were so reckless they shot two of their own number – Tagamoio’s crew came back next day in canoes shouting and firing off their guns as if believing that they were worthy of renown – Next day about twenty head men fled from the West bank and came to my house – There was no occasion now to tell them that the English had no desire for human blood – They begged hard that I should go over with them and settle with them and arrange where the new dwellings of each should be – I was so ashamed of the bloody Moslem company in which I found myself that I was unable to look at the Manyema – I confessed my grief and shame and was entreated, if I must go not to leave them now – Dugumbe spoke kindly to them and would protect them as well as he could against his own people</p>

<p>[579]<br />
but when I went to Tagamoio to ask back the wives and daughters of the headmen he always ran off and hid himself – This massacre was the most terrible scene I ever saw – I cannot describe my feelings but am thankful I did not give way to them but by Dugumbe’s advice avoided a blood feud with men who for the time seemed turned into Demons – The whole transaction was the more deplorable inasmuch as we have always heard from the Manyema that though the men of the districts may be engaged in actual hostilities the women pass from on[e] market place to another with their wares and were never known to be molested The change has come only with these alien bloodhounds – and all the bloodshed has taken place in order that captives might be seized where it could be done without danger and in order that the slaving privileges of a petty sultan should produce abundant fruit – [...]</p>

<p>As a material and visual object, the 1870 Field Diary differs both from Livingstone\'s other field diaries and from similar diaries kept by other Victorian travelers to Africa and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Usually, travelers of the era recorded their impressions in the field in bound journals or notebooks – such as Livingstone’s Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) or the small “pocket-books” (Waller, in Livingstone 1874:1,iv) that Livingstone used for all other periods of his final travels (1866-73) – or, at minimum, used unmarked leaves of paper. The 1870 Field Diary, by contrast, consists of a series of reused, heterogeneous, and unrelated printed and handwritten texts over which Livingstone has written his entries.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">"Dr. Livingstone reading the Bible to his men. Drawn from data furnished by Mr. H.M. Stanley." Illustration from Supplement to <em>The Graphic</em>, 25 April 1874, 393. <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/scotland/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Share-alike 2.5 UK: Scotland</a></em>. The image presents an idealized Victorian representation of Livingstone and some of his African attendants, drawn from Stanley\'s perspective. In Livingstone\'s case, for instance, the narrative of the 1870 Field Diary offers a rather different picture of explorer\'s physical health during the general period in question. From the <a href="/spectral-imaging/creating-1870-field-diary#link3">undertexts</a> that Livingstone used to create the 1870 Field diary, we also know that his reading during this period was more varied than just the Bible.</span></p>

<p>Livingstone’s complex decisions and practices in constructing the diary also contribute to its unique status as a nineteenth-century field record, one that serves as an iconic text of Victorian exploration under extreme circumstances. Careful study of the decisions and practices promises to enrich our understanding of Livingstone, his cultural contexts in both Britain and Africa, and, more broadly, the creation of nineteenth-century travel accounts in at least three ways.</p>

<p>First, the material and textual dimensions of the diary open a window onto Livingstone\'s circumstances in the field – his state of mind; his practices as an observer and diarist; the options available to him as a writer for British culture but one spatially isolated from that culture by virtue of his travels; and the impact of the African, Arab, and, to a lesser extent, Indian populations on his compositions.</p>

<p>Second, Livingstone\'s choices in constructing the diary also provide insight into nineteenth-century cultural and scientific expectations for the form such field notes should or could take. What were these expectations? Given his limited resources, how does Livingstone maintain a sense of scientific practice in his notes? And what might these tactics tell us about his specific priorities as a writer?</p>

<p>Finally, the 1870 Field Diary is a historical object, one that Livingstone carried with him to his death, that traveled after his death from the center of Africa to Britain, that appeared in edited form as part of the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874), and, finally, that survived, more or less intact, to the present day. What can the leaves of the diary tell us about this sequence of events?</p>

<p>This section of the edition develops a comprehensive account of the 1870 Field Diary as a constructed and preserved object, toward beginning a response to the above questions. In doing so, we explore the material creation of the diary, the structure that Livingstone (and, later, others) imposed on the text, prominent textual features, and, finally, the passage of the diary across hands, time, space.</p>

Livingstone kept the 1870 Field Diary with him until his death in 1873. The diary then traveled with Livingstone\'s body from central Africa (present-day Zambia) to Britain where Livingstone\'s family eventually distributed the diary\'s pages among a small number of archives.</span></p>

<p>The first two parts in our study of the "state of the manuscript" foreground Livingstone’s choices in creating the manuscript, with spectral images used only as necessary to illustrate key points. The last four parts, in turn, spotlight the diary’s long-term history and rely on spectral images to a much greater degree in order to outline Livingstone’s decisions in revising the text and the subsequent confluence of events that have resulted in the configuration and preservation of the manuscript as it stands today.</p>

<p>(<em>Note:</em> The name "1870 Field Diary" is a slight misnomer as the dates of the diary actually run from 17 August 1870 to 22 March 1871. However, there is no accepted collective name for the sequence of fragmentary texts that constitutes this diary, so we have used the name "1870 Field Diary" in order to distinguish this diary from the "1871 Field Diary," which is the subject of separate <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">critical edition</a> by the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>.)</p>

<p>Livingstone had run short of unmarked writing paper when he began to compose his 1870 Field Diary in August of that year. As a result, he reused a variety of documents (at least six) to record his diary entries and wrote his entries over the pre-existing printed and handwritten text on these documents (which we call undertexts or source texts).</p>

<p>The documents used for the 1870 Field Diary include (in order of use):</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) an anonymous review essay on Irish church history books from the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, April 1866 (Livingstone 1870b);<br />
2) a July 1866 letter to Livingstone from someone named Gorbello[?] (Livingstone 1870c);<br />
3) Arthur Penrhyn Stanley’s <em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em>, 1863 (Livingstone 1870e/1870f/1870i/1870j/1870k);<br />
4) Samuel White Baker’s “A Map of the Albert N’yanza” from the <em>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</em>, 1866 (Livingstone 1870h);<br />
5) an article (proof) by George Birdwood from the <em>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay</em>, 1863 (Livingstone 1871a/1871b); and<br />
6) the <em>Pall Mall Budget </em>, 21 August 1869 (Livingstone 1871e).</p>

<p>Collectively, these documents provide a snapshot of some of Livingstone’s reading during this period.</p>

<p>In composing his diary, Livingstone sometimes uses all the leaves of the given document (Livingstone 1870c, 1870h, 1871a/1871b). In other cases, he only uses a selection of leaves from the item (Livingstone 1870e/1870f/1870i/1870j/1870k, 1871e). In the case of 1870b, Livingstone includes only the margins of the leaves, which he has cut off and tied together into a small booklet. It is not possible to give an account of the leaves (or leaf sections) from the above texts that are not accounted for in Livingstone’s diary, as the missing leaves appear not to have survived. Livingstone may have used these missing leaves to compose other documents.</p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary may also have included source texts beyond those cited above. We do not know if another gathering preceded what we now call the first gathering (Livingstone 1870b; see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link4">Gatherings</a>). Pages V-IX and XV-XVI of the second gathering are missing, although these pages appear to have returned to Britain in the nineteenth century and served as the basis of a transcription by Agnes Livingstone (see Livingstone 1870d and 1870g). Livingstone, presumably, wrote these diary pages over reused documents, as he did those pages that precede and follow them in sequence. Finally, the National Archives of Zimbabwe hold <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A&quot;1870&quot;&amp;f[]=repository_ms%3A&quot;Zimbabwe.+National+Archives&quot;&amp;f[]=genre_ms%3A&quot;diaries&quot;">one fragment of the diary</a> (dated 25 August, 4 October, 8 October 1870), the original of which we were not able to consult for this edition due to budget restrictions, but that Clendennan and Cunningham (1979:276) cite as being written over a letter.</p>

<p>(For additional discussion of Livingstone’s reuse of source texts for his own texts during 1870 and 1871, see Clendennan and Cunningham 1979:346-47 and our critical edition of Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods#link2">1871 Field Diary</a>.)</p>

<p class="space2">The leaves of the 1870 Field Diary divide into two main gatherings. The first gathering comprises a small booklet constructed from the snipped page margins of a review essay from the <em>Quarterly Review</em> (Livingstone 1870b). The leaves of the first gathering are bound together on the left side with twine tied in a knot, visible in our images. The second gathering comprises the remaining leaves of the diary, i.e., the bulk of the text (Livingstone 1870c, 1870e, 1870h, 1870i, 1870j, 1870k, 1871a, 1871b, 1871e). Although unbound, the leaves of the second gathering form a sequence, and Livingstone has numbered the rectos and versos of these leaves with <a href="/spectral-imaging/structuring-1870-field-diary#link5">Roman numerals</a>.</p>

This gathering is incomplete as the first page begins mid-sentence, suggesting that one or more preceding leaves are missing. In addition, Agnes’s transcription of the 1870 Field Diary, which survives in Oxford’s Bodleian Library and is available <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A&quot;1870&quot;&amp;f[]=repository_ms%3A&quot;Bodleian+Library.+Weston+Library&quot;&amp;f[]=genre_ms%3A&quot;autographs+(manuscripts)&quot;">in full</a> from <em>Livingstone Online</em>, suggests that the pages currently missing from the beginning of this gathering were <em>already</em> missing by the time the diary reached Agnes since she omits them in her transcription. However, the text of the gathering is internally continuous, indicating that no leaves from the middle are missing. Likewise, the gathering ends with Livingstone’s signature, suggesting that this was the final leaf.</p>

The 37 leaves from Stanley’s book (Livingstone 1870e/1870f/1870i/1870j/1870k) or Birdwood’s article (Livingstone 1871a/1871b) each contain a page on the recto and verso for a total of 74 pages. The leaf of the letter from Gorbello[?] (Livingstone 1871c) contains two pages on the verso and two on the recto, for a total of four pages. The leaf of Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h) contains four pages on the recto and a single set of calculations on the verso for a total of four pages plus the verso (the latter of which is here treated here as a single page: 1870h:[map]). Finally, one leaf from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> (Livingstone 1871e) contains three pages on the recto, four on the verso; the other contains four on the recto, three on the verso, thus totaling 14 pages.</p>

<p class="space2">The leaves of the second gathering, unlike those of the first, are today disassembled and distributed over three repositories (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/structuring-1870-field-diary#link6">Sequencing by Archival Numbers</a>). There are also at least two gaps in the sequence of Livingstone’s numbered pages (pages V-IX and XV-XVI). As a result, we cannot describe with certainty how Livingstone kept the leaves of the second gathering together, although it is reasonable to suppose that he stored them in an ordered stack. The evidence of the leaves, in turn, shows that this stack would have consisted of at least five distinct sub-gatherings, each arranged in a different way.<a id="link6" name="link6"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong> First sub-gathering (Livingstone 1870c).</strong> 1870c forms a single sub-gathering. Livingstone has laid the four pages (I-IV) out two per side on the single leaf of the Gorbello[?] letter. The arrangement of these pages and their orientation relative to one another indicates that Livingstone originally folded this leaf between pages I and IV, so that these pages appeared on the outside – page I right-side up relative to the fold, page IV upside-down. On the inside, pages II and III appeared right-side up relative to the fold and so upside-down relative to one another.</p>

<p class="space2"><br />
The undertext pages thus do not run in sequence, and there is a gap between the first undertext leaf and the next two. These features suggest that Livingstone first tore these leaves out of the book, then wrote his diary entries only after flipping over vertically (thus not reorienting) the leaves with pages 23/24 and 21/22 of the undertext.<a id="link8" name="link8"></a></p>

Livingstone has divided the recto of this leaf into quadrants (apparently following the original folds of the map – see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link3">Original folds</a>), then placed a page in each quadrant. As laid out clockwise from the top left-hand quadrant, the pages are arranged as follows: XX, XVII, XVIII (upside-down), XIX (upside-down). Baker’s map, on the verso, is oriented the same way as pages XX and XVII.</p>

The image dramatically reveals the underlying folds in this leaf. Livingstone used these folds as guides for laying out the four pages of the diary that appear on this side of the leaf in natural light.</span></p>

<p class="space2">When the recto of this leaf is folded in the middle along the horizontal axis and the horizontal fold is then placed at the bottom, all of the pages will be right-side up. If the leaf is again folded in the middle, but now along the vertical axis so that pages XVII and XX are on the outside, a small booklet is formed, with Livingstone’s pages arranged in the following sequence: XVII (outside, vertical fold to left), XVIII (inside, left side), XIX (inside, right side), XX (outside, vertical fold to right). This arrangement also folds the unmarked map into the hidden interior of the booklet (thereby rendering it invisible to the reader), a point that helps account for why Livingstone did not write any diary entries over the map.<a id="link9" name="link9"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong> Fourth sub-gathering (Livingstone 1870i, 1870j, 1870k, 1871a, 1871b).</strong> Within this sub-gathering, Livingstone’s pages appear in an unbroken sequence, while the undertext leaves/pages run almost continuously, albeit in reverse order relative to Livingstone’s pages. All told, there are three main undertext sequences: 1) Stanley’s book, pages 92-69, 66-63, 60-53 (Livingstone 1870i:XXI-LV), 2) Stanley’s book, pages 114-95 (Livingstone 1870i:LVI-LXI, 1870j:LXII-LXIX, 1870k:LXX-LXXV), and 3) Birdwood’s article, pages 12-1 (Livingstone 1871a:LXXVI [v.1]-[LXXVI v.2], 1871b:LXXVIII-LXXXVII).</p>

<p>With one exception the pages of this sub-gathering are loose, and its arrangement is fairly easy to ascertain. On each leaf, Livingstone writes on the recto, then flips the leaf horizontally and writes on the verso. As a result, the sub-gathering functions like an unbound booklet where, as each successive leaf is flipped up, the pages of the resulting two-page opening are both oriented right-side up, one above the other. Assorted page-to-page smearing of Livingstone’s text supports the case for this arrangement of Livingstone’s diary leaves, as do more pronounced saturation patterns on pages XXV-LV and, separately, LVI-LXI (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link6">The big stain</a>).</p>

<p>Additional damage to the leaves in this sub-gathering is also consistent with the arrangement. Indeed, in combination with topographical spectral images, the arrangement reveals two important patterns of damage. In the first case it is clear that some sort of sharp object has punctured successive leaves of the diary (LV [v.2] downward to at least XXXV) and that this occurred after Livingstone had written his text and arranged the leaves, as the puncture obscures Livingstone’s writing on multiple pages.</p>

<p>In the second case, the appropriate arrangement of leaves shows the presence of a small hole in one corner, again across multiple leaves (pages XXI-LV). This hole, like the puncture, was made after Livingstone wrote, as the hole also removes parts of the diary text. However, given its corner placement, this hole may be where Livingstone tied this set of pages together, as he did with the booklet made up of <em>Quarterly Review</em> margins (Livingstone 1870b). In fact, on the earlier pages in the sequence, the hole more resembles a tear running all the way to the edge of the page (see especially pages XXI-XXVI), as would happen with a thread working through the pages as they were lifted and lowered repeatedly (for more on the damage, see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link8">Manuscript holes</a>).</p>

The original binding string is visible on the right side between these two images.</span></p>

<p class="space2">The one (partial) exception to the proposed arrangement of this sub-gathering spans pages LXII-LXIX. Here the original leaves of Stanley’s book remain bound together two and two, indicating that Livingstone removed these pages from the book rather than tear them out one by one. As a result, it appears that in arranging these leaves, Livingstone first folded each pairing, then placed the second inside of the first (or that he simply kept the arrangement as originally set in Stanley’s book – binding string from Stanley’s book is visible in our images). The result is that these four leaves – in contrast to the other leaves in this sub-gathering which appear to have been stacked on top of one another – form a small, semi-bound booklet.<a id="link10" name="link10"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong> Fifth sub-gathering (1871e).</strong> Livingstone was beginning to run low on any kind of writing paper when he began to compose the pages that constitute the fifth and final sub-gathering of the 1870 Field Diary. As a result, he shifted from the sturdier book pages of the previous sub-gatherings to more fragile newspaper pages for this sub-gathering and, subsequently, for the bulk of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods#link2">1871 Field Diary</a>. Pages LXXXVIII-CI thus appear on the recto and verso of two leaves of the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em>.</p>

<p>By comparison to the preceding leaves of Stanley’s book (215mm x 140mm) and Birdwood’s article (215mm x 140mm), the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> leaves are significantly larger (385mm x 270mm), thereby enabling Livingstone to divide each side of each newspaper leaf into four quadrants. One diary page appears per quadrant, except for pages XC and CI, which each span two quadrants from top to bottom. The resulting layout of pages across the two leaves, then, is slightly irregular.</p>

The image shows the close relationship between the principal horizontal and vertical folds in the leaf and the layout of Livingstone\'s pages in relation to these folds.</span></p>

<p>The evidence of our topographical spectral images, especially when set against the evidence of the textual layout, indicates that Livingstone folded each leaf twice when arranging this sub-gathering (or that he reused existing folds in this source text – see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link3">Original folds</a>). First, he folded along the vertical axis with the left side folding below the right side, then a second time along the horizontal axis with the bottom folding below the top. This resulted in diary pages (192.5mm x 135mm) of roughly the size of the preceding book and article pages.</p>

<p>Thanks to this folding, four of the pages (the lower-numbered ones on the given leaf) went to the outside and the intended reader could read this sub-gathering as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">1) Read the lowest-numbered page (LXXXVIII or XCV, respectively);<br />
2) Flip once along the horizontal axis to read the next page (LXXXIX or XCVI);<br />
3) Flip along the horizontal axis again, but now open the horizontal fold and read the two visible pages top to bottom (XC first part to XC second part, or XCVII to XCVIII).</p>

<p>With this point reached, the reader could now turn to the interior pages. To access these pages, however, required more folding:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">4) Unfold along the vertical access to show the full leaf, then refold along the vertical axis so that the left page now goes over the right;<br />
5) Fold along the horizontal axis so that the top goes over the bottom;<br />
6) Flip along the horizontal axis (first <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> leaf) or rotate 180 degrees (second <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> leaf).</p>

<p>Finally, from here, the sequence of reading restarted with step #1 above.</p>

<p>The first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870b) consists of clippings derived from the top, bottom, gutter, and outside margins of a review article from the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. In this gathering Livingstone writes on the successive rectos and versos of all the leaves. Livingstone’s text relative to the printed text (which is not always visible on the given clipping) may be parallel, perpendicular, or upside-down.</p>

<p>In the second gathering, Livingstone writes across full pages (rather than marginal clippings) and most often composes one numbered diary page per side of leaf. Usually, such numbered pages appear on both the recto and the verso of the given leaf. Livingstone also tends to write his entries perpendicular to the underlying pre-printed, so that the printed text appears 90 degrees clockwise relative to Livingstone’s text.</p>

This the only set of pages written over a leaf from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> where all of Livingstone\'s pages have the same orientation.</span></p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to the above rules, however. In terms of layout exceptions, Livingstone places the first four numbered pages (1870b:I-IV), two per side (I and IV, and II and III, respectively), over the recto and verso of the letter from Gorbello[?]. He also composes either three or four pages on each side of each leaf when writing over the two leaves from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> (Livingstone 1871e). In two of the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> cases, he divides the side of a leaf into quadrants, resulting in four pages per side of leaf. In the other two cases, he divides the side of the leaf into halves, then subdivides only one of the halves, meaning that one diary page covers half of the leaf, while the other two each cover a quadrant, resulting in three pages per side of leaf.</p>

<p>In terms of orientation exceptions, Livingstone writes parallel to printed text on Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]) and to the printed text on 1871a:[LXXVI v.2]. He also writes parallel to handwritten undertext on 1870c:IV and 1870h:XVII. The pages on the leaves of the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> (Livingstone 1871e) are usually oriented in two directions, so that on any given leaf side half the pages are upside-down relative to the other half. As a result, on these leaves the printed undertext may be 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise relative to Livingstone’s text. 1871e:XCI, XCII, XCIII, and XCIV, which occupy one side of one <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> leaf, however, all have the same orientation. As a result, the printed undertext on this side of this leaf runs 90 degrees counter-clockwise relative to that of all of Livingstone’s numbered pages.</p>

In the case of 1871a:LXXVI [v.1], although there is no printed or handwritten undertext, a series of calculations run 90 degrees clockwise to the main diary text and would have been parallel to the print text were there any (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link15">Additional notes on the undertexts</a> for more on the calculations; 1870i:LII also has one underlying calculation [in Livingstone’s hand] that runs parallel to the main diary text.)</p>

<p class="space2">The above analysis indicates that Livingstone developed the manuscript of the 1870 Field Diary in stages, over time. In addition, it is clear that Livingstone also engaged the diary’s source texts in a number of ways prior to using them to composed the main text of the diary. Definitive dating of the initial interactions appears impossible either based on internal evidence or by corroboration from other Livingstone documents. Nonetheless, some general points based on reasonable inference may be made about the nature and sequence of these interactions. These points help account for the placement of text and other markings on various parts of the diary.<a id="link13" name="link13"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong> Acquisition of the undertexts.</strong> Livingstone wrote the 1870 Field Diary over a heterogeneous series of printed and handwritten documents, as previously noted (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link3">Livingstone\'s Undertexts</a>). The dates of these original documents (1863, 1866, 1869) indicate that he probably took some of the documents with him on his final journey (1866-73), while others arrived en route.</p>

In this segment, Livingstone directly refers to the anonymous review of books on Irish Chursh History from the <em>Quarterly Review</em> that he uses as the source text for the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870b).</span></p>

<p class="space2">From the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre-0">Letter from Bambarre</a> (Livingstone 1871c), for instance, we know that Horace Waller sent Livingstone the copy of <em>The Standard</em> (24 November 1869) upon which the latter eventually wrote the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a> (Livingstone 1871f). The near contemporaneous dating of the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> leaves of 21 August 1869 (Livingstone 1871e) suggests that Livingstone received this document from Waller as well. Additionally, the 10 March 1870 “Retrospect” references the <em>Quarterly Review</em> essay (see Livingstone 1870a:[7]) so Livingstone clearly had the essay by that date.<a id="link14" name="link14"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong> Annotation of one undertext.</strong> As a first step to using the undertext documents, Livingstone appears to have annotated at least one of them. Multiple pages from Stanley’s&nbsp;<em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em> bear marginal annotations in the form of a straight penciled line alongside several lines from the printed text.</p>

<p>On a significant portion of pages the annotations are in gray pencil (1870i:XXI, XXIV-XXVIII, XXXIII-XXXV, XXXVII, XLVI, XLVIII, L, LI, LIV, LV [v.1], LV [v.2]); a few pages have annotations in red pencil (1870i:LXI; 1870j:LXVI, LXVIII; 1870k:LXX).&nbsp;1870i:XXVIII also has several lines of printed text underlined. The general thematic unity of the annotated passages provides insights into Livingstone’s interests as a reader of this text.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong> Additional notes on the undertexts.</strong> Concurrently with marginal annotations or, at least, in advance of writing the main text of the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone also appears to have made notes on a few of the source texts. For instance, 1871a:LXXVI [v.1] includes a series of calculations (more than any other page in the diary) made in pencil and in a number of different inks. Some of these calculations clearly run under the main diary text. (For another example of an underlying calculation, see 1870i:LII.) Indeed, the diary text on 1871a:LXXVI [v.1] uncharacteristically stops before the bottom of the page – just before the part of the page where the majority of calculations lie.</p>

<p>Based on these characteristics, it seems probable that Livingstone used this page first for calculations at different times, then reused it when he composed the main diary text. The fact that this page is the back of the last page of Birdwood’s article from the <em>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay </em>also makes the page a likely place for such ad hoc calculations.</p>

<p>Similarly, 1871a:[LXXVI v.2] bears a map (with annotations) whose ink clearly differs from the diary pages that precede and follow this one. The text of this map also, uniquely, runs parallel to the underlying printed text (rather than perpendicular) – a characteristic not present on any other page of the diary excepting those written on the back of Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]; see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link11">Page Layout and Orientation</a>). These features (and the lack of any diary text on this page) suggest that Livingstone drew this map in advance of drafting the main diary text.</p>

<p>At least one other map also appears to pre-date the composition of the main text. This map appears at the bottom of 1870h:XVII. Analysis of our spectral images suggests that this map is of a different ink from the text on the rest of the page. Indeed the text on this page generally goes around the map, although a few parts of the map clearly lie underneath the page’s main text. As a result, it again seems likely that Livingstone drafted this map prior to writing the main diary text on this page. (For more on the maps on 1870h:XVII and 1871a:[LXXVI v.2] see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1#link8">Pre-composition</a>.)</p>

Beneath Livingstone\'s main text in this image (in black) appear two additional lines (in blue): “Mr andso [sic] twill be / when I am gone.” </span></p>

<p>Finally, 1871b:LXXXVII has two short lines of text in Livingstone’s hand that run parallel to the main text but appear beneath it. These lines read: “Mr [A]ndso twill be when I am gone.” The identity of the individual named is not known, and the meaning of these lines is also otherwise unclear.</p>

<p class="rtecenter">*</p>

<p>The state of the 1870 Field Diary, therefore, reflects a complex series of decisions that Livingstone made in assembling and arranging the text. By foregrounding those decisions by reading the pieces of this scattered text in an integrated fashion, we can partially recover the conditions under which Livingstone wrote and traveled, and and we can outline his frameworks for recording information. The next part of this essay explores additional structures imposed on the manuscript over time and discusses other prominent textual features.</p>

<p>Research for our critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary has resulted in the production of a significant amount of supporting documentation. This documentation encompasses all aspects of the project and, as a whole, offers an intimate glimpse into project development. The project team has curated this documentation in a handful of ways. First, the team has organized the documentation into categories of project endeavor in order to facilitate study of individual files or file sequences. As part of this, we have removed duplicate or variant files with the goal of being representative (rather than exhaustive) about our research. Second, documentation files have been renamed to reflect the contents and actual order of research activities (although, as users will find, research activities did not always take an organized form and involved much trial and error). Finally, we have lightly edited the documentation to remove personal information or other sensitive material such as passwords.</p>

<p>Several factors limit the study of the original 1870 Field Diary manuscript leaves. First, the leaves, often out of sequence, reside in several repositories. This makes comparative side by side study impossible, both among different segments of text (for instance, the first and second gatherings) and within different segments (e.g., all the pages in the second gathering written over the leaves from Stanley).</p>

<p>Additionally, many leaves have been laminated or otherwise flattened in a manner that has potentially transformed – in non-trivial ways – key material characteristics of the leaves such as page folds or impressions (for instance, the leaves from the David Livingstone Centre and the British Library).</p>

<p>Finally, the leaves at the National Library of Scotland are today encased in archival quality polyester film that prevents direct handling of the pages and dramatically circumscribes options for studying manuscript topography, as members of the project team found when examining these leaves in 2015.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project has been able to apply a number of strategies to surmount these limitations. First, we were able to arrange for the National Library Scotland leaves to be removed from their sleeves for imaging. To create those images, we used high-resolution photography rather than scanning, which could further flatten the leaves.</p>

The animation alternates between a color image and a raking light image and shows elements of page topography not visible under natural light (i.e., the color image), thereby foregrounding the relationship of these topographical elements to the handwritten text and staining on the page.</span></p>

<p>In addition, our workflow also included using raking spectral image lights. Such raking lights illuminate the given manuscript page at oblique angles (i.e., from the sides rather than from above) and so, in our case, have allowed for producing processed 3D spectral image reconstructions of page topography from raw 2D spectral images.</p>

<p>These processed raking light images offer an extraordinary window onto page topography, or the collection of folds, impression, holes, and other features inscribed on the surface of the page - often beneath the printed and handwritten text. This enables us, in turn, to examine material manuscript features that are obscured in the originals or that might pass unnoticed for other reasons, such as creases being too faint to see with the naked eye or page discoloration impeding study of page impressions.</p>

<p>As a result, in the following subsections we explore the handling of Livingstone’s manuscript over time through such features as folds, impressions, holes, and torn pages.</p>

<p><a id="link2" name="link2"></a></p>

<p>The history of the manuscript pages of Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary begins outside of Africa, in Britain and wherever else the paper was produced and where the original source texts were printed or handwritten on the pages. This history helps account for the topography of the manuscript pages today, both for those pages that are relatively flat (because they originally formed part of a bound volume) and those that have been folded due to the original publication format.</p>

<p class="space2"><a id="link3" name="link3"></a>Attention to original format offers the potential to help scholars distinguish between “original” folds (i.e., folds introduced as part of the process of creating the texts prior to Livingstone’s handling of them) and folds introduced later in the manuscript’s history, whether by Livingstone or someone else.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>Original folds</strong>. Livingstone’s source texts might be divided into two groups: those that have folds consistent with potential expectations for those texts (1870b, 1870e/1870f/1870i/1870j/1870k, 1870h, 1871e) and those that do not allow for easy assumptions about their “original” state (1870c, 1871a/1871b).</p>

<p>For example, our processed spectral images (especially raking, color_raking, and IC3) show that the leaves drawn from the <em>Quarterly Review</em> (Livingstone 1870b) and Stanley (Livingstone 1870e/1870f/1870i/1870j/1870k) are generally flat in a manner consistent with them being taken from a bound volume, while the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> leaves (Livingstone 1871e) have a prominent central vertical fold that reflects the possibility of that periodical being folded in half for distribution.</p>

<p class="space1" style="line-height:110%"><a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/the-diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2/liv_000204_0002_color_raking-article.jpg"><img alt="A spectral image of Samuel W.

<span style="font-size:12px;">A spectral image of Samuel W. Baker\'s map of the Albert N\'yanza [Lake Albert] from the <em>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</em> (Livingstone 1870h:[map] color_raking). <em>Copyright David Livingstone Centre. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. This processed image, which combines a color image with a raking image, presents the page folds – including the prominent horizontal fold at the center of the map – relative to the printed text on the page.</span></p>

<p>Likewise, Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h), which appeared in the <em>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</em>, also has a prominent central horizontal fold and secondary horizontal and vertical folds that suggest that the map was folded down to a smaller size for inclusion in the <em>Journal</em> as were the many other surviving exemplars of this map (and other similar maps published by the <em>Journal</em>).</p>

<p>Conversely, the pieces from Gorbello[?] (Livingstone 1870c) and Birdwood (Livingstone 1871e) have a more singular nature. Presumably, the letter from Gorbello[?] would have been folded in order to be sent to Livingstone, but that is not a given and a lack of spectral images for this item prevents detailed study. That said, visual inspection of the natural light images reveals that there is at least one horizontal fold across the leaf’s central axis, where the letter would have been folded in half prior, presumably, to be sent to Livingstone.</p>

<p class="space2">The unusual character of the Birdwood item – a proof copy of a forthcoming article – offers even more limited grounds for baseline expectations,<a id="link4" name="link4"></a> and, indeed, our processed spectral images show no pattern of folding that might be decisively ascribed individuals handling this source text before Livingstone.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>Broad patterns and categories of manuscript folding</strong>. The presence of original folds in the leaves, however, does not cover all the cases of the manuscript folds visible in our processed spectral images. Although too numerous to describe individually, the manuscript’s folds readily fall into a handful of patterns:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) extensive but fairly minor folding (1870b);<br />
2) minor folding of page corners in a random fashion (1870e/1870f, 1870i:XXI-LV, 1870i:LX-LXI, 1870j:LXII-LXIX);<br />
3) asymmetrical folding of pages that, in both natural light and processed spectral images, bear prominent traces of saturation (1870i:LV-LIX);<br />
4) inconsistent vertical and diagonal folding (1870k:LXX-LXXV);<br />
5a) consistent and clearly deliberate vertical and horizontal folding (1870h:XVII-XX);<br />
5b) consistent and clearly deliberate vertical and horizontal folding (1871e:LXXXVIII-CI); and<br />
6) inconsistent, but deliberate vertical folding coupled with asymmetrical and apparently random folding (1871a/1871b)</p>

<p>Study of these patterns in relation to the source texts and other evidence reveals that we might link each of the patterns to a single source text (<em>Quarterly Review</em>: pattern #1; Stanley: patterns #2, 3, and 4; Baker: pattern #5a; <em>Pall Mall Budget</em>: pattern #5b; and Birdwood: pattern #6), and also allows us to group the patterns into broader categories.</p>

The folding here follows no discernable pattern and may be due to saturation or other handling that occurred while the manuscript was in Livingstone\'s possession.</span></p>

<p>Some patterns are probably a direct result of Livingstone’s handling of the manuscript. For instance, the asymmetrical folding on pages with prominent saturation (pattern #3) points to a close relationship between the two phenomena and suggests that the event that caused the saturation – which occurred while Livingstone was still alive – also produced the folding (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link6">The big stain</a>).</p>

<p>Other patterns seem to follow on from Livingstone’s reconfiguration of the source texts to create the diary (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">Creating the 1870 Field Diary</a>), as in the case of the many minor folds and creases visible on the leaves of the first gathering (pattern #1), which are generally consistent with Livingstone (and others after him) slightly bending up the leaves while handling and flipping through the pages of this gathering.</p>

<p>Yet other patterns do not easily allow for any kind of categorical account. The deliberate folds at the center of diary pages written over the Birdwood leaves (pattern #6), to take one example, show that someone folded these leaves in half at some point (perhaps to keep them together?), but the available evidence prevents further assessment as to whether this folding (or, for that matter, the many other folds and creases visible at the edges of these pages) happened before the leaves came into Livingstone’s possession, while they were in his possession, or after his death.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">A processed spectral image of three pages of the 1870 Field Diary that Livingstone wrote over a single page from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> (Livingstone 1870e:XCIX, C, CI raking). <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland and, as relevant, Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. The principal folds here align with expectations for this source text and so were probably instituted by other individuals before the text reached Livingstone.</span></p>

<p>Finally, some patterns clearly align with expectations as to how the source texts might have initially been folded (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link3">Original folds</a>), and so it seems likely that others individuals instituted those folding patterns before the source texts reached Livingstone (patterns #2, #5a, #5b).</p>

<p>As a result, some questions about the folds in Livingstone’s manuscript must necessarily remain. However, the evidence available – especially as enhanced or revealed by our project – does enable us to offer a casual account of the majority of folds in the manuscript, to understand how these folds relate to the evolving functions of the manuscript (and its source texts) over time, and, ultimately, to weave the history of these folds into a larger chronology of events in the life of the 1870 Field Diary.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Page Impressions</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span>⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Our raking light spectral images also enable study of the impressions on Livingstone’s manuscript pages. In contrast to the folds, the impressions bear a much more subtle and varied character and so appear too extensive and diverse to characterize comprehensively. In fact, nearly every page of the 1870 Field Diary exhibits a variety of seemingly ad hoc impressions across its surface. There are two exceptions, however, which differ significantly from all other impressions made on the pages of the manuscript.</p>

<p>First, sequential review of the leaves of the second gathering shows that nearly every page in each of the following sequences – 1870e, 1870i/1870j/1870k/1871a/1871b, and perhaps others – bears a horizontal oval impression that roughly spans the extent of printed text on the page, top and bottom, left and right. On a handful of pages, additional heavier impressions appear on the edges of the oval, and these impressions roughly but imperfectly trace the contours of the oval.</p>

The topography on this page includes the oval impression that appears on a series of pages in this part of the diary.</span></p>

<p>The contours of the oval do not lend themselves to an obvious explanation. The oval may arise from general humidity, however subtle, in the central African environment and/or the interaction between this humidity and the printed ink on the page. Alternately, given that as Livingstone wrote on one page, he would have presumably kept the preceding pages in a stack, the oval may be the impression of some object that he used as a paper weight. However, such interpretations grow more from inference than evidence.</p>

<p>The oval may also hold some connection with the other, truly exceptional impression on the recto and verso of a single leaf of the source text (1870i:XXXV-XXXVI). This impression proves nearly impossible to study through first-hand examination of the original leaf at the National Library of Scotland, but our spectral images bring the impression out with striking clarity.</p>

The natural image of this page only hints at the complexity of the underlying topography through the semi-circular smearing of Livingstone\'s handwritten text.</span></p>

<p>In its basic character, the impression takes the form of a circle with a series of jagged lines radiating out from its circumference and, in some cases, running in rather deep channels to the edge of the leaf. The indentations visible on 1870i:XXXV suggest that the impression originated on this side of the leaf. The nature of the impression allows for a few significant characterizations, although definitive assessment must be elusive without additional evidence.</p>

<p>For instance, visual inspection of Livingstone’s handwritten text shows that it is smeared and that this smearing precisely follows the contours of the impression, a point that suggests that Livingstone’s writing pre-dates the impression.</p>

This spectral image, processed to highlight staining, helps characterize the extent of the circular impression on the page.</span></p>

<p>Next, other than the smearing, neither our raking images nor any of our other processed spectral images indicate that there is any other sort of substance on the page in the vicinity of the impression consistent with its shape. In other words, it seems likely that the impression is due to liquid saturation and that that liquid was water.</p>

<p>Finally, given the shape and potential liquid substance, it seems quite likely that Livingstone or someone else placed a cup or other such container with water onto the page, and the water from this vessel saturated the page to produce the pattern we see today.</p>

<p>The location of the circle relative to the more subtle oval impression (i.e., in the center of the oval) – which our raking images show to be present even on the two sides of the leaf in question – further suggests that the oval impression on all the relevant diary pages may be due to this vessel, but that for whatever reason the vessel only saturated this page.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">Another spectral image of that same page from the 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870i:XXXV raking). <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland and, as relevant, Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. The dramatic circular topography, visible in this image due to the use of raking lights, distinguishes this leaf from all the others that constitute the 1870 Field Diary.</span></p>

<p>However, this conclusion proves more speculative. As noted, the impression appears to begin on 1870i:XXXV and carries over to 1870i:XXXVI. If Livingstone were writing in sequence in the diary (not a given, of course, but a more likely scenario based on the evidence available in this part of the diary) and if the impression were made only after Livingstone wrote his text, then we would expect it to originate on 1870i:XXXVI, not 1870i:XXXV, as 1870i:XXXVI would have been the leaf facing up if Livingstone had just completed it, placed it on the stack of previous pages, and moved on the page 1870i:XXXVII.</p>

<p>Additionally, the impression, in its stark prominence, is limited to 1870i:XXXV and XXXVI, and there appears little if any trace of the impression in either the natural light or raking images of the pages either preceding or succeeding the leaf in question. This suggests that the impression was made on the leaf at a point when it was separated from the main stack of the diary pages, but point also takes our interpretation to the limits of what can be drawn from the evidence.</p>

<p>Although nothing prevents first-hand study of the torn pages from and holes in Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary manuscript in natural light, the variety of our spectral image renderings allows for a more detailed study of the characteristics of these features. The manuscript exhibits a variety of minor holes and tears, especially along the edges of the pages, but the majority of these appear to derive from regular handling of the pages and do not necessitate further comment.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">Images of two pages from the 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870e:XII; 1870i:XLV). <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland and, as relevant, Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. The edges of the pages here are consistent with being torn out of the original book, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley’s <em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em> (1863), and pre-date Livingstone\'s composition of the 1870 Field Diary text since he clearly writes around the torn parts of the pages.</span></p>

<p class="space2">Likewise, the pages written over the leaves from Stanley’s book exhibit a few jagged edges clearly due to the leaves being ripped unevenly from the book (see, for instance, pages 1870e:XII/XIII, 1870i:XXV/XXVI-XXIX/XXX, and especially 1870i:XXXIII-XLVI). <a id="link7" name="link7"></a>Given that Livingstone has written around such edges, they obviously pre-date his composition of the 1870 Field Diary. The cases cited below, therefore, fall outside of the above categories.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>Torn pages</strong>. Only one set of pages, 1870k:LXXIV/LXXV, merits further discussion in this respect. These two pages, which occupy a single leaf from the Birdwood source text, have a larger portion of the page torn out on the right edge. This tear, which is generally straight except for when it curves towards the edge of the page center, has taken out the ends of a series of Livingstone’s handwritten lines.</p>

<p class="space2">As a result, in contrast to the cases just cited where such tears pre-date Livingstone’s composition and indeed he writes around them, the evidence here suggests that this tear post-dates Livingstone’s composition of his text.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a><strong>Manuscript holes</strong>. Again, beyond the cases cited above, only two sets of holes in the manuscript pages require further discussion.</p>

<p>One of these sets has already received substantial review elsewhere (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link9">Fourth sub-gathering</a>), so those observations need not be revisited here, other than stating that the characteristics of this set of holes (1870i:XXI-LV) indicate that Livingstone used string or twine woven through the holes to hold together these leaves together.</p>

<p>Indeed, we know from the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary that Livingstone employed this practice on occasion because the leaves of the first gathering (1870b) remain bound to the present day, apparently with Livingstone’s original twine (visible in the images of 1870b:[70]).</p>

Livingstone used twine looped through two small holes – both twine and holes are visible on the right-hand side of this image – to bind the pages of the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary into a small booklet. For another picture of this twine, see <a href="/spectral-imaging/creating-1870-field-diary#link4">Gatherings</a>.</span></p>

<p>The other hole in the 1870 Field Diary manuscript represents another of the diary’s most interesting features. The hole originates on page 1870i:LV [v.2] where it has its broadest extent and is most prominent, then works its way backwards through the leaves of the diary, in an ever diminishing fashion, to page 1870i:XXXV – although there is no discernible relationship between this hole and the unique circular impression on 1870i:XXXV (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link5">Page Impressions</a>).</p>

<p>On page 1870i:LV [v.2], the hole takes the form of a small, diagonally-oriented oval and consists of a large opening around which portions of the page are bunched up; on page 1870i:XXXV, the hole is in fact no longer a hole, but a small cluster of faint impressions or indentations on the surface of the leaf. The pages between these two extremes present an ever evolving transitional character in terms of the hole.</p>

This processed image, which combines a color image and a raking image, highlights the extent of the damage done to the manuscript when a sharp object punctured this page and the sequence of pages preceding it.</span></p>

<p>The character of the hole indicates that some object punctured or pierced through a series of leaves, but stopped short of going all the way down. Whether the object was sharp or blunt is hard to tell because a blunt object could have done the trick if the pages were saturated enough.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, the event occurred after Livingstone had written his text because the hole takes out his writing on successive pages. Additionally, despite the coexistence of a significant stain on the majority of pages where the hole appears (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link6">The big stain</a>), our project team’s analysis of the two phenomena suggests that the piercing is separate from the stain.</p>

This page was one of the last to be impacted by the object that punctured this segment of the 1870 Field Diary (see above). As a result, although the manuscript hole becomes quite pronounced on the pages that follow, on this page topography the puncture registers only as a series of fairly minor impressions in the upper right-hand center of the page.</span></p>

<p>The origins of this puncture remain unknown, but certainly do not seem consistent with something that Livingstone – an otherwise meticulous and careful writer – would have done to his own manuscript deliberately.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that he attempted to compensate for this manuscript damage, as he did for smeared words in his manuscript by retracing them with Zingifure ink long after their original composition (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1#link10">Reinking and Revision</a>). From this, we think it is possible that this incident occurred after Livingstone’s death, when the manuscript and his body were being transported from the interior of Africa to the east coast by the porters who had travelled with him.</p>

<p class="rtecenter">*</p>

<p>The topography of 1870 Field Diary offers another lens through which to understand the history of the manuscript. Elements such as folds, impression, torn pages, and manuscript holes reveal the diverse functions of the manuscript pages both before and after they became a part of the diary. The elements also show the close relationships between the materiality of the manuscript and Livingstone’s decisions in arranging and composing his text. The next part of this essay concludes this strand of our analysis by considering the impact of various environments on the pages of the diary.</p>

On first glance, the facsimile appears to be an exact reproduction of the diary page, thereby potentially enabling scholars to gauge the fading of the ink between 1874 and 2010 (when the diary was spectrally imaged). However, although Livingstone’s handwritten overtext looks the same, the position and size of the newsprint undertext appears to have changed relative to the overtext! The phenomenon is particularly obviously when one examines the position of the word "valleys" which appears in the center of the left-hand side of both images. How is this possible?</p>

<p>David McClay, the curator of the John Murray Archive at the National Library of Scotland kindly explained the process by which the facsimile was created in an email to Adrian S. Wisnicki:</p>

<p>"The illustration would have most likely been produced using the process of colour lithograph where separate stones (or metal plates) were produced by hand for each colour to be used, then printed one colour at a time. The technique was pioneered in the 1830s but only came into wider commercial use only by the 1860s and it was the most popular method of colour reproduction until the end of the 19th century. The two plates have been misaligned in the final printing process, therefore the variation in original and reproduction. I have checked the John Murray Archives to see if the ledgers have confirmation of production details, although not definitive I can confirm that Cooper Hodson was responsible for producing the facsimile [of Livingstone’s writing] for which he was paid £60 16s 4d – a not inconsiderable amount" (McClay 2011).</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">The first page of the <em>Letter from Bambarre</em> (Livingstone 1871c:[1]) as illuminated by twelve wavelenghts of light, ranging from the ultraviolet (365nm), upper left corner, to the near infrared (870nm), lower right corer. <em>Copyright Peter and Nejma Beard. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em></span></p>

<p>There are two levels of spectral imaging: hyperspectral and multispectral. With hyperspectral imaging, an object is exposed to a broad range of very narrow wavelengths across the UV, visible and IR portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Multispectral imaging (the technique applied to Livingstone’s letter) only exposes the object to a set of predetermined wavelengths in this portion of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Although first pioneered by NASA for studying the solar system, spectral imaging has since been used in a variety of contexts, from satellite imaging and forensics to biology, and national security studies. In 1993 the Dead Sea Scrolls became among the first manuscripts to be studied with spectral imaging. By imaging the scrolls with infrared film, researchers tried to recover faded or illegible text and passages.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/" target="_blank">Archimedes Palimpsest Project</a>, begun in 1999, used spectral imaging to enhance a medieval palimpsest – a document whose original text has been scraped away, then overwritten – that contained otherwise unavailable treatises of the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes. In this case, the imaging scientists sought to separate out the "undertext" (the treatises by Archimedes and fragments of other works) from the "overtext" (a thirteenth-century prayer book).</p>

<p>Spectral imaging therefore offers the potential recovery of passages and even whole texts that might otherwise be inaccessible to researchers. Because the process can capture a wide range of material characteristics of a document, spectral imaging also embodies an important digital preservation technology.</p>

<p>Aside from the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Archimedes Palimpsest, scientists have applied spectral imaging techniques to the Herculaneum scrolls, the Petra scrolls, medieval palimpsests held at St. Catherine’s Monastery of Sinai, and an early medical Syriac Palimpsest. Due to technical innovations introduced by the Archimedes Palimpsest team, in recent years spectral imaging has also been applied to more contemporary documents, including the 1507 Waldseemuller Map, which includes the first cartographic use of the term "America," the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, and the "Nicolay Copy" of the Gettysburg Address.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s February 1871 letter to Waller is the first nineteenth-century British manuscript to be captured with the spectral imaging process.</p>

In the case of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary, such processing relies on the fact that different ink types on a given page (for instance, Livingstone’s ink, the ink of the newsprint, etc.) behave differently under different bands of wavelengths of light. Imaging scientists can use this differentiated behavior to create processed images (renderings of combinations of bands) that distinguish among what may be otherwise very subtle differences in color.</p>

<p>The Livingstone team has applied spectral image processing to nearly all the pages of the 1871 Field Diary in order to address the principal challenges posed by this manuscript:</p>

<ol>
	<li>the fading of Livingstone’s handwritten text to the point of invisibility in much of the diary, and</li>
	<li>the additional difficulty in reading Livingstone’s text due to the continuing prominence of the newsprint over which he wrote.</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to these challenges, the team took as its primary processing objectives, first, suppressing the printed text, and, second, enhancing Livingstone’s handwritten text. Additional objectives included developing the "intercept" processing method to clarify indecipherable text and processing with raking light images to highlight manuscript topography (in the latter case, limited to those folia that had not been laminated, see <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript">The Manuscript</a>; for topographical processing also see <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary</a>). The team also used raw spectral image data to produce highly accurate color images of each diary page.</p>

<p>A <a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images">separte section</a> provides details of the many processing methods developed for Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a> and the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870</a> and <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871</a> Field Diaries, each of which is the subject of a separate multispectral critical edition. Further information on the processing of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary also appears in the <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-history-2#link15">relevant part</a> of the project history.</p>

<p>As Livingstone and his men travel further away from the coast and begin to head towards Lake Nyassa, Livingstone first encounters the problems that would dog him for the remainder of his last journey: food scarcity, the slave trade, and mutiny among his men. Although Livingstone first notes the group’s hunger early in the diary, they receive food from a friendly chief. As men trek further into the interior of Africa, however, it becomes more and more difficult to procure enough food. Though Livingstone repeatedly sends his men off to buy food with cloth, they often come back empty-handed or with inadequate supplies.</p>

<p>Early on, Livingstone shrugs this off – “these are the little troubles of travelling &amp; scarcely worth mentioning” – yet because they repeatedly “get no food except a little green Sorghum,” shortage of food becomes a recurrent topic throughout the diary (Livingstone 1866b:[8], [9]). Many of the local African words Livingstone learns and records during this period have to do with food, including sugar, pepper, and cooking utensils.</p>

<p>The food shortage is caused in part by the slave trade, as the slavers have cornered the market with their lavish payments. Livingstone encounters more and more evidence of the slave trade as his journey continues, from a taming sticks early on (used to keep slaves yoked together) to the bodies of slaves tied to trees and left to die when they were too weak to keep up with the group.</p>

<p>The later entries in this diary include scathing indictments of African complicity with slaving, as they purportedly captured members of other ethnic groups in retaliation and sold them to the Arabs for cloth (Livingstone 1866b:[95]). Livingstone concludes, “it is a most pernicious error of the Ethnographers that savages are influenced by fear alone – this may possibly be the case in Australia but it is not true of Africans” (Livingstone 1866b:[103]). In this, he suggests that Africans perpetuated their own destruction in the slave trade through greed and local conflicts.</p>

<p>During this time, Livingstone also encounters the struggles for authority that would continue for the rest of this journey and these, too, happened in relation to the food shortage. Suffering from hunger and fatigue, the Sepoys (Indians serving in the British army whom Livingstone recruited in Bombay) refuse to walk “on pretence of being unable to march” (Livingstone 1866b:[27]). For the rest of the diary, Livingstone records his attempts to first ignore, then threaten the Sepoys, recognizing that “the chief difficulty at present arises from famine” (Livingstone 1866b:[54]).</p>

<p>This diary takes the same form as the two before it, a 153mm tall x 96 mm wide x 9 mm thick side-bound hardback notebook bound in green silk. And as in previous field diaries, Livingstone writes from both ends of the diary at once, starting at the opposite end upside down. Livingstone begins in blue pencil but shifts to grey pencil starting on 1 June 1866. This diary contains an unusually large number of drawings, mostly of tattoos and mountains, though it also contains other maps and jottings.</p>

<p>In addition, shifting away from the more strictly narrative record of travel, the diary also contains many observations about African culture, including many drawings of tattoos and notes on their meaning, describing them as “a sort of heraldry” (Livingstone 1866b:[37]). Livingstone also records local agriculture, topography, food preparation methods, pottery, and practices in sickness.</p>

<p>More than the previous two notebooks, Field Diary III appears to function both as a reference work in the moment as well as a record for future writing. In addition to the usual notes about wages and loads to carry, Livingstone takes down first-hand information from Africans. Toward the end of the journal he labels one map “Chirikaloma’s account of North end of Lake journey of Kandulo" (Livingstone 1866b:[104]).</p>

<p>Livingstone also asks a chief to write his name on the facing page, which he does in Arabic. Livingstone then transliterates the name as “Bonārie o boana salale” and notes the language as “Somalie,” thereby underscoring the diverse African populations that Arab expansion helps escort into east and central Africa (Livingstone 1866b:[17]). The moment also shows a shift toward Livingstone’s eventual use of the field diaries as both reference and record of his experiences, shaped and marked by those around him.</p>

Unfortunately, his subsequent journey to Africa (1858-64) revealed that many of his plans for African colonization and development had been poorly conceived.</p>

Bambarre lies almost exactly at the center of the map, just west of Lake Tanganyika (see section detail, below). The lines in red trace Livingstone\'s three journeys around and across Africa.</span></p>

<p>The last journey, which began in March 1866, offered a chance to alter the trajectory of Livingstone’s career and restore his reputation. He sought to examine the watershed of Central Africa, promote the introduction of commerce into the region, and, ultimately, locate the most southern source of the Nile, the grand geographical prize of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>However, after three unsuccessful years exploring the lakes and rivers to the south of Lake Tanganyika, Livingstone realized that he would have to examine a river that ran to the west of the lake, the Lualaba, in order to determine the river’s connection – if any – to the Nile. In March 1869 Livingstone reached Ujiji, an Arab trading depot on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. By the end of July 1869 he had crossed the lake and was heading west, intent on rapidly passing through the region of Manyema in order to strike the Lualaba "roughly three hundred miles west of Ujiji" (Jeal 1973:326). He planned to finish exploring the river in six months then return to Ujiji.</p>

<p>After a year of travel, however, he had managed to get only as far as Bambarre, a village 150 miles west of Lake Tanganyika. Deserted by all but three followers and severely depressed, he had been delayed by pneumonia, fever, dysentery, heavy anal bleeding, and "irritable ulcers on the feet" (Livingstone 1870e:X; Jeal 1973:326-31).</p>

<p>Yet on 4 February 1871, Livingstone gained new hope. Ten men sent by John Kirk, acting Consul and Political Resident at Zanzibar, arrived in Bambarre bringing supplies and letters – including three from Waller – with the first news of Europe that Livingstone had had for several years. The next day, 5 February 1871, Livingstone began writing his letter to Waller.</p>

<p>In the twentieth century, the letter surfaced at a Sotheby’s auction in London (Catalogue 1966:44), where it was purchased by Peter Beard, the American photographer. Beard, equally renowned for his photos of celebrities <em>and</em> Africa and African wildlife, was immediately taken with the letter and has remained so to the present day. In late 1966 or early 1967, he transported the letter to "Hog Ranch," his property in Kenya, which lies adjacent to the farm of Karen Blixen, author of <em>Out of Africa</em>.</p>

<p>Beard kept the letter there until 1991, when a termite infestation, which had already damaged some first edition Africana books, compelled him and his wife Nejma to take the letter to their home in Manhattan. "I carried the letter to New York from Kenya," writes Nejma Beard of transporting the framed letter. "I took it through London, with my baby daughter Zara under one arm and the letter under the other! It was heavy I can tell you" (private communication to A. Wisnicki).</p>

<p>In late 2009, just as the diary project was being developed, the Beards contacted <em>Livingstone Online</em> through an intermediary, Elizabeth Upper, and offered to make the letter available for scholarly study. Planning for the critical edition began there and then.</p>

<p>The spectral imaging of the 1871 Field Diary and associated documents produced raw image sets of 202 Livingstone folia in total, not including extraneous image sets and sets of documents imaged for the NLS. 50 of these image sets (those of laminated folia) each contained 12 registered spectral image "digital negative" files (DNGs), while the remaining 152 image sets contained 16 DNGs due to the inclusion of "raking light" images. In other words, the spectral imaging of Livingstone’s diary resulted in the creation of 3,032 "raw" images files totalling, roughly, 750 GB of data. This data required processing by the team’s imaging scientists in order to make Livingstone’s handwritten text accessible to specialists and the public-at-large.</p>

<p>Spectral image processing uses tailored mathematical algorithms in order to manipulate and enhance raw spectral image data. In the case of Livingstone’s manuscripts, such processing relies on the fact that different ink types on a given page (for instance, Livingstone’s ink, the ink of the newsprint, etc.) behave differently under different bands of wavelengths of light. Imaging scientists use this differentiated behavior to create processed images (renderings of combinations of bands) that distinguish among what may be otherwise very subtle differences in color. The processing of the Livingstone data began while the team was still in Scotland in June 2010 and lasted well into the spring of 2011.</p>

In addition, Easton and his student [qtip:Caroline Houston|Caroline Houston (Rochester Institute of Technology).

The PCA technique uses combinations of an original set of images to construct an equivalent set of images ordered by statistical variance. The first principal component is a combination of the original images with the largest variance; the second principal component is the combination of the original with the next largest variance orthogonal to the first, etc. Images from initial PC bands ("high order" bands) correspond to the smallest data variances. If the images contain objects that differ in color, they may be distinguished ("segmented") in the set of principal components.</p>

<p>Once the PC images are produced, the scientists examine the images to identify those that show different inks and insert these images into the red, green, and blue channels (RGB) of a "pseudocolor" (false color) image. If the handwritten ink appears as "light" in one of the PC images and "dark" in another, then the corresponding pixels may exhibit a color tone in the pseudocolor image that allows easier differentiation between the handwritten and printed texts. If necessary, the scientists further manipulate the pseudocolor image by using appropriate software to rotate the hue angle of the pseudocolor image to generate new combinations of the principal components. However, the process is not conducive to automation because of the manual steps involved and so is most feasible for the study of exceptionally illegible portions of text.</p>

<p>The first of these additional techniques lent itself to automation and so could be applied across all the Livingstone data sets without additional cost or labor. In December 2010, [qtip:Knox|Keith Knox. Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] discovered that although Livingstone’s writing faded as the wavelengths increased (and completely disappeared at the 940 nm wavelength), the printed text remained fairly constant across the spectrum. Knox therefore calculated the numerical ratio of the 450 nm, 592 nm, and 850 nm images relative to the 940 nm separation and put the resulting three images into, respectively, the red, green, and blue channels of a pseudocolor image. This technique effectively suppressed the printed text and made Livingstone’s handwriting very visible.</p>

<p>A second technique, which could be partly automated, focused on minimizing ink bleedthrough. This technique involved rendering pseudocolor images using combinations of raw spectral images. In this case, [qtip:Knox|Keith Knox. Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] selected two images of the recto side of a given leaf (the 505 nm and 780 nm illuminations), and one image of the verso (505 nm) that he flipped horizontally. He performed a spatially local normalization of contrast and brightness on each image, then inserted these three images into, respectively, the red, green, and blue channels of a pseudocolor image. The resulting image displayed the recto text in cyan-blue and the verso text in green-yellow, a combination that significantly enhanced the legibility of the recto text.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Processing Objectives and Results.</strong> The Livingstone team developed a list of leaves for processing after the preliminary processing in June 2010, which established the viability of recovering Livingstone’s text.

<p>The scholar-scientist discussions also resulted in comparative analysis of processing techniques and the development of additional PCA and pseudocolor processing strategies, some of which could be automated. These additional techniques included a pseudocolor method that suppresses all written and printed text, and that highlights paper topography (raking). Furthermore, during this period, [qtip:Christens-Barry|Bill Christens-Barry (Equipoise Imaging, LLC).

<p>Preliminary spectral imaging of Livingstone’s diary in Scotland and follow-up spectral image processing generated a significant amount of data and metadata. This data required far-sighted and detail-oriented data management to ensure efficient capture, production, and organization for long-term viability. The team’s data manager, [qtip:Doug Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT).

<p>The team summarized data management objectives in their original NEH grant application: "The Nyangwe field diary project will provide a complete package of images with documentation and full metadata. The resulting archive data set will be based on the archive and metadata model used for the Archimedes Palimpsest. The product will be a completely self-documenting and autonomous data set. […] This will be a full digital archive of images that meets library and archival standards, as we have produced for previous projects."</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Preliminary Data Management.</strong> The team followed a series of intermediate steps to meet the data objectives, a process that spanned nearly the whole 18-month NEH and British Academy grant periods. The process began prior to imaging in Scotland with a series of discussions by email and teleconference in which the team set out the details of the data archive deliverable [now the <a href="/islandora/search?access=view_spectral">Livingstone Spectral Image Collection</a>], began to define <a href="/spectral-imaging/xml-coding-practices">XML transcription guidelines</a>, and assessed metadata needs of key stakeholders.

<p>During this period, [qtip:Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] began planning for the collection of appropriate metadata. He created a spreadsheet of the folia to be imaged that included location shelfmark (DLC or NLS), details of Livingstone’s handwritten "overtexts" and pre-printed "undertexts," and shots required (to identify folia to be imaged in segments). He reconfigured his online logging application to meet project needs and used the application to create Livingstone imaging projects and associated shot sequences. Finally, he instructed the imaging scientists in collecting image setup data.</p>

<p class="space2">From Baltimore, Emery continued to support daily metadata collection while the team imaged in Scotland – a heroic task given that it entailed waking up each day at 2:30 a.m. EST in order to be available for the team start time of 8:30 a.m. GMT!<a id="link21" name="link21"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>"Data Scrubbing."</strong> [Update note: The file naming scheme described in this section of the project history has since been replaced with a more standardized <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript-citation-and-file-naming-practices">spectral image file naming scheme</a> that corresponds to overall <em>Livingstone Online</em> <a href="/behind-scenes/practices-standards-and-arrangements#psa5">file naming practices</a>.]</p>

<p>Once imaging ended, the team moved to a lengthy period of data assessment and correction. In late July 2011, [qtip:Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] produced an initial evaluation of the Livingstone data, then based on this evaluation he, [qtip:Toth|Michael B. Toth (R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], and [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] sought to refine the existing data management plan. In the coming months, Toth also outlined the overall path forward in a series of emails to the team, ultimately developing a phased approach based on prioritized goals, capability needs, and funding available for each phase.</p>

<p>The duration of the assessment and correction period had partly to do with the file-naming scheme created by the team. The scheme took the following form:</p>

<p>This scheme produced a rather lengthy name for each image file, e.g., DLC297b_149-146_012r_0_A.dng. The advantage of the scheme lay in how much information it recorded. The disadvantage of the scheme, which the team realized only in hindsight, inhered in its complexity. The scheme allowed for a wide margin of error, especially as the hours and days in the darkened imaging room lengthened. Moreover, the need for preliminary processing during the imaging phase and beyond resulted in the exponential propagation of incorrect file names.</p>

<p>After [qtip:Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]’s evaluation, [qtip:Knox|Keith Knox. Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] and [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] collaborated in reviewing and correcting the raw data and Knox’s processed data. Using Wisnicki’s list of file and folder corrections and additional input, Knox "scrubbed" the data in a series of steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>identify and correct duplicates, misnamed files, and excess files;</li>
	<li>create command files to convert the data according to Wisnicki’s list;</li>
	<li>produce PowerPoint summary of data set.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process – which required many, many hours due to the complexity of the files names – lasted from August to December 2010, significantly longer than anticipated.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Creating the Data Archive.</strong> The need for extensive data correction pushed the spectral image processing phase to the spring of 2011.

<p>In the NEH grant application, the team had described this next phase as follows: "After imaging and processing is completed, the imaging logs will be collated with other required metadata to generate complete metadata records for raw and processed images, and to assemble the final data archive." To realize these objectives, [qtip:Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] needed to complete a complex series of discrete tasks. These covered preparing the raw data, collecting the new data produced by the team, assembling and refining the database, collecting and building the metadata, and loading and packaging the data.</p>

<p>The decision to encode each folio of Livingstone’s diary separately represented one of the Livingstone team’s most important encoding decisions. With some exceptions, each folio of Livingstone’s diary contains two diary pages, one on the left-hand side, one on the right-hand side. Adjacent pages are almost never continuous because Livingstone stacked, then folded the leaves of the diary to make two copy-books (now disassembled). As a result, the team chose to represent the physical artifact (the manuscript as it is) rather than the semantic artifact (what Livingstone "intended") in order to reflect the current state of the diary and to coordinate with the structure of the data archive, where the images for each folio would reside in a separate directory. [Note: the <a href="/islandora/search?access=view_spectral">spectral image collection</a>, which replaces the data archive in the present edition of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, now provides integrated access to XML-based transcriptions of all the folia of the <a href="/islandora/search/&quot;1871 Field Diary&quot; NOT integrated NOT segment?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue">1871 Field Diary</a> in a manner that reflects the features of the diary as <em>both</em> physical and semantic artifact.]</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Transcription Outcomes.</strong> Livingstone’s words had taken an exceptionally long detour in their travels, but now had almost reached their destination. [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] and [qtip:Simpson|Kate Simpson (Edinburgh Napier University).

They succeeded in transcribing – and so making accessible – 99% of the diary’s original text for the first time since Livingstone wrote the document 140 years ago. Issues such as fading, blotting, bad handwriting, or missing pieces of the manuscript prevented the remaining 1% from being deciphered.</p>

<p>The majority of the issues fell outside the remit of the [first phase of the] <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>, which focused on using spectral image processing to separate Livingstone’s words from the printed texts over which he wrote. In other words, the team had a success rate of nearly 100%, an outcome that far exceeded even the most optimistic team predictions and that rendered unnecessary a number of alternative imaging and processing strategies outlined in the original NEH grant application.</p>

<p>To complete the transcription and encoding process, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] collaborated with research assistant [qtip:Heather F. Ball|Heather F. Ball (Morgan Library and Museum). Research assistant for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] to produce an XML transcription of the corresponding portion of the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874). This transcription refined and corrected the rough transcription available from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024?msg=welcome_stranger" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>. Wisnicki, Ball, and [qtip:A.J. Schmitz|A.J. Schmitz (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Research assistant for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] (Wisnicki’s graduate assistant from Indiana University of Pennsylvania) then corrected and revised the <em>Last Journals</em> transcription to produce an encoded version of the relevant portion of Livingstone’s handwritten Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72). Schmitz also used macros created for <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" target="_blank">ImageJ</a> by [qtip:Christens-Barry|Bill Christens-Barry (Equipoise Imaging, LLC). Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] to produce line-by-line mappings of the 1871 Field Diary.</p>

<p>Thanks to these final efforts, readers of the 1871 Field Diary would be able to study the original words of the diary alongside the revised 1872 Unyanyembe Journal version and the 1874 <em>Last Journals</em> published version. They would be able to <a href="/spectral-imaging/three-versions-1871-field-diary">survey firsthand</a> the vast distance that separated the original and published versions of the diary and, as a result, trace the extent to which subsequent revisions by Livingstone, Waller, and others had transformed the original historical record. The mappings, when incorporated into the XML transcriptions, would also help support software tools to relate passages on the images to the transcriptions and vice versa [to date (2017), such software has not been implemented].</p>

<p>The team designed the new site features to showcase the scholarly and scientific accomplishments of the Livingstone team. The electronic edition also contains a selection of custom designed web pages:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><a href="/islandora/search/&quot;1871 Field Diary&quot; NOT integrated NOT segment?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue">Images and Transcriptions</a> – Enables users to examine processed spectral ratio image versions of individual pages of the 1871 Field Diary alongside transcriptions. The embedded viewer allows users to view, rotate, otherwise manipulate, and download all processed spectral image versions of each page of the diary.</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><u>Color &amp; Spectral Images</u> [combined with the previous section in the present edition] – Allows users to view color and processed spectral images side by side.</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><a href="/spectral-imaging/three-versions-1871-field-diary">Three Versions of the Text</a> – Comparative page that enables users to study the three versions of Livingstone’s text (1871 Field Diary, 1872 Unyanyembe Journal, 1874 <em>Last Journals</em>).</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><u>Search Page</u> [not available in the updated edition] – Enables users to search through and sort the full text of the 1871 Field Diary by keyword and significant XML-tagged content</p>

<p>Finally, the electronic edition includes a Project History &amp; Archive section [the present Project History page plus the <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-documentation-0">Project Documentation</a> page], which offers a detailed and, at times, intimate look into the inner workings of the [first phase of the] <a href="/spectral-imaging/spectral-imaging-overview">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>. Users can now not only overview the different stages by which the project evolved, but also download a representative selection of raw working documents produced in the course of the team’s efforts. As a result, the Project History &amp; Archive section both catalogues the extent of people and resources required to undertake a significant spectral imaging and publication project and offers a roadmap for teams wishing to undertake similar projects in the future.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Preliminary Data Analysis.</strong> The spectral imaging and transcription of Livingstone’s diary produced a treasure trove of data. Alongside many other tasks, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] worked with team members to develop a preliminary analysis of this data during the final phase of the project. This endeavor embraced a number of discrete activities.</p>

<p>First, Wisnicki produced a detailed history of the diary that tracked the manuscript from the nineteenth century to the present day. [qtip:Anne Martin|Anne Martin (David Livingstone Centre). Institutional contact for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] (DLC) and [qtip:Alison Metcalfe|Alison Metcalfe (National Library of Scotland). Institutional contact for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] (NLS) supplied a number of crucial, internal documents to support the research. These documents coupled with materials previously assembled enabled Wisnicki to track – for the first time – the complex journey of the diary that ultimately resulted in the document becoming the first significant nineteenth-century British manuscript to be enhanced with multispectral image processing.</p>

<p>[qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] also undertook a careful examination of Livingstone’s methods for composing and structuring the manuscript. This examination built on the XML encoding of the manuscript by Wisnicki and [qtip:Simpson|Kate Simpson (Edinburgh Napier University). Research assistant for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], an endeavor that drew attention to a wide range of unique textual and material manuscript features. Wisnicki identified the practices Livingstone employed on a day-to-day basis in writing up his experiences and catalogued Livingstone’s strategies for organizing entries in the two copy-books that make up the key portion of the diary.</p>

<p>Most importantly, Wisnicki turned his attention to Livingstone’s inks. As far back as December 2009, Wisnicki had suggested to Gustavo Fermin (the assistant of Peter Beard, owner of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a>) that Livingstone – in recoding the Nyangwe massacre – had, apparently, switched from the improvised ink he used to compose most of the 1871 field diary to what may have been his last supply of iron gall ink. This suggested that Livingstone had grasped the significance of the events unfolding before him and decided that it was worth drawing on his dwindling ink stock to produce a permanent record.</p>

<p>Fenella France (U.S. Library of Congress) advised [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] on the development of new techniques to identify and characterize inks and colorants, while [qtip:Easton|Roger L. Easton, Jr. (Rochester Institute of Technology). Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] applied these techniques to generate the reflectance spectra for a sample of pages from the diary. The resulting graphs, which Easton collected in a series of PowerPoints, supported through scientific data what Wisnicki had previously deduced based on visual study of the processed images (especially the two paragraphs on page 297b/146).</p>

<p>During this phase, [qtip:Harrison|Debbie Harrison (Birkbeck, University of London). Contributing editor and outreach director for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] carried out detailed comparative analysis of the 1871, 1872, and 1874 versions of the text. This work would become the basis of both future research and the press campaign (see below), while [qtip:Simpson|Kate Simpson (Edinburgh Napier University). Research assistant for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] heroically assisted Wisnicki in completing numerous tasks related to the diary’s critical apparatus. Wisnicki also carried out further analysis of the three texts to develop the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-1871">Livingstone in 1871</a> section, which overviews some of the key new information revealed by the 1871 Field Diary. In addition, Simpson consulted with Ulrike Al-Khamis, a specialist in Arab/Islamic Art and Culture at the University of Edinburgh, and Paul Dundas, a Sanskrit specialist also at Edinburgh, to discuss a number of questions related to the Arab traders with whom Livingstone had travelled and to explore the issue of dating in Livingstone’s diary.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Dissemination, Results Release, and the "UK Tour."</strong> The Livingstone team\'s dissemination strategy focused on both general and academic audiences. To reach academics, team members delivered a series of talks while the project was developing. These included conference presentations, lectures, and a "lightning round" presentation (two minutes, three images) on the project at the 2010 NEH Project Directors Meeting in Washington, D.C., on 28 September 2010. Alongside these presentations, the team also distributed an announcement to academic sites to mark the publication of the revised edition of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a> in May 2011.</p>

<p>The initial publication of <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter</a> in July 2010 had received international print and broadcast coverage, a development that underscored continuing global interest in Livingstone. As a result, [qtip:Harrison|Debbie Harrison (Birkbeck, University of London). Contributing editor and outreach director for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] focused on both the project\'s academic and scientific dimensions in developing her press campaign for the publication of the 1871 Field Diary. She directed the team in drafting an appealing and dramatic press release with a strong public interest theme. She also sought to accommodate the complexity of the project and to acknowledge the broad range of collaborating individuals and institutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="/spectral-imaging/press-materials">promotional materials</a> for the 1871 Field Diary included press releases aimed at the US and UK press, vivid project images, and briefing notes on key individuals, contributing institutions, and the scientific and literary dimensions of the project. This approach delivered a powerful story that focused on the human interest aspects of Livingstone\'s ordeals, while simultaneously providing sufficient biographical and technical information to satisfy the needs of the specialist press.</p>

<p>The Livingstone team decided to release full project results in a "beta" edition on 1 November 2011, a propitious date given that it translated to 1/11/11 (US) or 11/1/11 (UK). More importantly, the date roughly coincided with the 140th anniversary of the Livingstone-Stanley meeting. Although Livingstone and Stanley offered divergent dates for their meeting (a point of <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-stanley-meeting">continuing scholarly debate</a>), the 1 November date represented a compromise between Livingstone\'s original date of 28 October 1871 (in the 1872 Unyanyembe Journal version) and Stanley\'s of 3 November 1871 (in a despatch to <em>The New York Herald</em>). While developing the beta edition, the Livingstone team also made plans to release a formal "first edition" of project results in the spring of 2012.</p>

<p>The team marked the beta release of project results with a British Academy-funded "UK tour" that included meetings with stakeholders and presentations at the National Library of Scotland on 1 November, the David Livingstone Centre on 3 November, the University of Oxford on 4 November, and Birkbeck, University of London on 5 November 2011. The team gave the presentations as panel lectures in which team members representing scholarship ([qtip:Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]), science ([qtip:Knox|Keith Knox. Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]), technology and conservation ([qtip:Toth|Michael B. Toth (R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]), outreach ([qtip:Harrison|Debbie Harrison (Birkbeck, University of London). Contributing editor and outreach director for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]), and postgraduate research ([qtip:Simpson|Kate Simpson (Edinburgh Napier University). Research assistant for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]) described their roles on the project. These presentations solidified the project accomplishments for team members, stakeholders, and the public. By the last presentation, the team felt that they had decisively conveyed the significance of being the first people to restore and read Livingstone\'s diary since the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class="space2">The Livingstone team carried out its work despite encountering a number of significant challenges. The team mitigated some of these challenges; other challenges delayed or compromised parts of the overall production schedule, but the team still delivered the final product within the NEH and British Academy grant periods. The principal challenges related to project funding, communication, and file naming.<a id="link32" name="link32"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Challenge #1: Project Funding.</strong> The NEH grant brought the project to life and enabled it to accomplish its proposed goals of spectrally imaging and processing the manuscript of Livingstone’s diary. The team knew this project posed risks as proposed, especially with more complex tasks that might be uncompensated. The British Academy grant helped support the imaging effort in Scotland (June-July 2010) as well as a follow up visit (Oct.-Nov. 2011) to promote the project, share results with stakeholders, and receive feedback on the final product. However, the team proved unsuccessful in supplementing these funds during the NEH and British Academy grant periods to support additional work required. This outcome combined with an unflagging team ethic of delivering, as one member put it, "a BMW project on VW prices," resulted in every funded project member providing significant work for the project out of scope. Unfunded team members, in turn, uniformly assisted on a pro bono basis.</p>

<p class="space2">That said, everyone committed to the project or offered to contribute their time and talents – whatever the opportunity cost – foremost from a desire to support a worthwhile endeavor: the restoration of a key manuscript from a visionary explorer whose abolitionist ideals and progressive ideas on the intellectual capabilities of Africans often far surpassed those of his contemporaries. In retrospect, however, it became clear that the team should have developed the project in two, separately-funded phases, the first focusing on the creation of the data archive, the second on the critical edition of the diary. In particular, additional funding for the spectral image data capture phase would have allowed for a higher level of programmatic maturity, including better attention to data organization and data copying from the moment of capture.<a id="link33" name="link33"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Challenge #2: Communication.</strong> The first phase of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> brought together individuals residing across the UK and U.S., working in a variety of discrete fields, and affiliated with very diverse institutions. Team members and institutional representatives rarely met in person due to funding limitations, and most involved in the project spoke very different professional languages, a point that could create miscommunication despite the best intentions of everyone involved. Coordinating project phases and activities also proved challenging, especially given the limited time project personnel could devote to the project and the additional barrier of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">A common language: Members of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project team (Ken Boydston, Bill Christens-Barry, Roger L. Easton, Jr., Kate Simpson, Michael B. Toth, Alison Metcalfe, Adrian S. Wisnicki, Debbie Harrison) celebrate the end of the spectral imaging of the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries, Edinburgh, 2010. <em>Copyright Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project team. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em></span></p>

<p class="space2">Preliminary imaging in Scotland did build strong relationships among and between team members and institutional stakeholders, and, furthermore, the Livingstone team used communications technology (email, teleconferences, Skype, file-sharing sites) to maintain these relationships and to draw on expertise available through the project team. However, a number of problems encountered during the spectral imaging phase in Scotland, including a large project footprint, might have been mitigated by a more comprehensive site survey. Additionally, regularly scheduled teleconferences as well as shorter briefings focused on bridging disciplinary divides might have enhanced communication among team members during all stages of the project.<a id="link34" name="link34"></a></p>

<p class="space2"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Challenge #3: File Naming.</strong> Initially, the team planned to deliver the final products (the data archive and the critical edition of the diary) to coincide with the 140th anniversary of the Nyangwe Massacre on 15 July 2011. However, a series of production delays associated with new image processing and data management challenges prevented the team from working to schedule. Processing carbon inks on paper with different spectral responses required additional experimentation and development of refined techniques from those used previously on palimpsests. Data management challenges all led back to the complexity built into the spectral image file naming scheme devised by the team (see <a href="#link21">"Data Scrubbing"</a>). Fortunately, the 140th anniversary of the Livingstone-Stanley meeting offered a viable alternative publication date – first, because the anniversary also fell within the NEH and British Academy grant periods, and, second, because the 1871 Field Diary leads up to that meeting and even contains evidence that may help scholars determine the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-stanley-meeting">date of the meeting</a>. That said, the team could have avoided these delays. The need to have simple spectral image file names represents one of the major lessons learned of the project. [Update note: This lesson did eventually lead to the implementation of simplified <a href="/behind-scenes/practices-standards-and-arrangements#psa5">file naming practices</a> for the <em>Livingstone Online</em> project as a whole.] <a id="link35" name="link35"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Future Projects</strong> The <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> laid the groundwork for a number of future collaborative projects, as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="space1">The project established solid working relationships among the scholarly and scientific team members, and between the team and institutional representatives from the David Livingstone Centre and the National Library of Scotland. These relationships represent the basis for future projects on Livingstone, especially as both institutions boast major holdings related to the explorer. [Update note: The relationships established by the 1871 Field Diary with these two institutions in fact became the basis of the subsequent <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project (<a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2017">LEAP</a>, 2013-17) and a multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870 Field Diary</a> (2013-17; see next bullet point).]</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="space1">The team has already collected the raw spectral data needed to support projects on Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary (a.k.a. the Bambarre Field Diary) and select letters from the 1871 as well as Sir John Franklin’s 1821 Field Diary (see <a href="#link14">Imaging Schedule and Objectives</a>). [Update note: <em>Livingstone Online</em> published the beta edition of Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870 Field Diary</a> in late 2016; the raw spectral images of Franklin\'s 1821 Field Diary have not to date (2017) been published.]</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="space1">Finally, [qtip:Harrison|Debbie Harrison (Birkbeck, University of London). Contributing editor and outreach director for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] has created an innovative outreach program for British schoolchildren based on the project to be piloted in collaboration with the David Livingstone Centre.

<p>Livingstone refers to many African locations and geographical features, as well as numbers of African, Arab, and Indian names – sometimes spelled phonetically or with multiple variants. In order to make these references more easily interpretable, we have compiled an extensive glossary of the people, groups, places, and features cited in the manuscripts imaged by the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.</p>

<p>Livingstone composed his 1870 and 1871 manuscripts mainly in two locations, the small central African villages of Bambarre (1870-71) and Nyangwe (1871). The references in his manuscripts, however, illustrate the complex, multicultural array of people who influenced Livingstone\'s ideas and writings during this period and reveal the wide span of geographical information, often collected from African and Arab travelers and traders, to which Livingstone had access.</p>

<p>A range of the villages mentioned by Livingstone no longer exist and many of the African and Arab individuals remain unknown except for the details provided by Livingstone himself. As a result, the glossary offers a window onto the unique, otherwise unavailable geographical information that circulated during Livingstone\'s time in Central Africa and enumerates the names of people that might otherwise be lost to history.</p>

<p>To compile this glossary, we have drawn on a combination of sources, including Clendennan and Cunningham\'s <em>Catalogue</em> (1979, 1985), the <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> (2016), Lipschutz and Rasmussen\'s <em>Dictionary of African Historical Biography</em> (1986), Wikipedia, Simpson’s <em>Dark Companions</em> (1975), the Livingstone biographies of Jeal (1974, 2013) and Ross (2002), and Livingstone\'s manuscripts themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Malawi (Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania)</strong> - Also Nyassa. Also known as Lake Nyasa (in Tanzania) and Lago Niassa (in Mozambique). Although not the first European to do so, Livingstone visited this lake in 1859 and gave it the name Lake Nyassa.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Mweru (Zambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo)</strong> - Also Lake Moero. Livingstone incorrectly believed that this lake was part of the Nile river system. The lake is actually part of the Congo river system.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Tanganyika (Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Zambia)</strong> - When he wrote the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone incorrectly believed that this lake was part of the Nile river system. The lake is actually part of the Congo river system.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Victoria (Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya)</strong> - Also called Upper Tanganyika, Victoria Nyanza, and Nyanza by Livingstone. In 1858, explorer John H. Speke (1827-1864) became the first European to visit the lake, which he named after Queen Victoria, and asserted correctly but without definitive evidence to be the source of the Nile. Livingstone refused to recognize Speke\'s assertion.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Victoria (Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya) and Lake Albert (Uganda)</strong> - Also called Lower and Upper Tanganyika, respectively, by Livingstone. Livingstone incorrectly believed that these two distinct and unrelated lakes were in fact part of one larger lake.</p>

<p><strong>Lindi River</strong> - Tributary of the Lualaba River in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<p><strong>Lomami/Lomani River</strong> - Also called Lomame, Loeki, Lofubu, Lualaba West,&nbsp;Young\'s Lualaba, Young\'s River, and&nbsp;Young\'s Lake River by Livingstone. Major river in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. Livingstone believed that the Lomami/Lomani formed part of the Nile River system, but in fact the river joins the Lualaba River to become the Congo River. Livingstone named the river after James Young (1811-1883), a Scottish industrialist who later become one of Livingstone\'s trustees. Livingstone called it the "lake river" because he believed that it flowed through the fictitious Lake Chibungo (renamed Lake Lincoln by Livingstone).</p>

<p><strong>Lualaba River</strong> - Also called Central Lualaba, Lualaba East, Lacustrine River, Webb\'s Lualaba, and Lake River Webb by Livingstone. Major river in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. Livingstone believed that the Lualaba formed part of the Nile River system, but in fact the river joins the Lomami/Lomani River to become the Congo River. Livingstone named the river after hunter William F. Webb (1829-1899). Livingstone called it a "lake river" because he believed that it united with the Lufira River to form the fictitious Lake Kamolondo.</p>

<p><strong>Luapula River</strong> - Also called New Zambesi by Livingstone. River that links Lakes Mweru and Bangweolo and that forms part of the border between present-day Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Portuguese explorers and travelers, "armchair geographer" William D. Cooley (1795[?]-1883), and, initially, Livingstone all incorrectly believed that this river was a tributary of the Zambesi River.</p>

<p><strong>Lufira River</strong> - Also called Bartle Frere\'s Lualaba by Livingstone. Tributary of the Lualaba River in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. Livingstone believed that the Lufira united with the Lualaba River to form the fictitious Lake Kamolondo. Livingstone named the source of the river after British colonial administrator H. Bartle E. Frere (1815-1884).</p>

<p><strong>Lukuga River</strong> - Also called Luamo by Livingstone. Principal outlet of Lake Tanganyika; runs west from the lake through the eastern part of present-day Democratic Republic of Congo and eventually joins the Lualaba River.</p>

<p><strong>Metamba</strong> - Also Metambe. Rainforest in the northeastern part of present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo that is home to the Lega people and that encompasses the valleys of the middle and upper Elila and the upper Ulindi rivers.</p>

<p><strong>Mophi</strong> - With Crophi, one of two hills with conical tops that Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, placed in central Africa and cited as lying between the sources of the Nile to the north and of the Zambesi to the south.</p>

<p><strong>Mount Kenya</strong> - Second highest mountain in Africa (after Kilimanjaro), located in present-day Kenya.</p>

<p><strong>Mount Kilimanjaro</strong> - Highest mountain in Africa, located in present-day Tanzania.</p>

<p><strong>Nile River</strong> - Major river in Africa and longest river in the world. The search for the source(s) of the Nile motivated the African expeditions of a number of important Victorian explorers, among them Richard Burton (1821-1890), John H. Speke (1827-1864), Samuel W. Baker (1821-1893), Henry M. Stanley (1841-1904), and, of course, Livingstone himself.</p>

<p><strong>Nile valley</strong> - Region surrounding the northern part of the Nile river.</p>

<p><strong>Pison</strong> - One of four rivers said to flow from the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p><strong>Ptolemy\'s Mountains of the Moon.</strong> - Legendary African mountain range cited by Ptolemy (c.100-c.170), the ancient geographer, as being located at the source of the Nile River.</p>

<p><strong>Riverine Lakes</strong> - Set of central African lakes that, on Livingstone\'s understanding, included the real Lakes Bangweulu, Tanganyika, Victoria, and Albert plus the fictitious Lakes Chibungo (a.k.a. Lake Lincoln) and Kamolondo.</p>

<p><strong>Ruvuma River</strong> - Also Rovuma River. Significant river in East Africa that forms part of the border between present-day Tanzania and Mozambique.</p>

<p><strong>Shire River</strong> - Major river in present-day Malawi that flows out of Lake Malawi and is a tributary of the Zambesi River. Livingstone visited the river in 1859 during his second expedition to Africa (1858-64).</p>

<p><strong>Source of the Kafue River</strong> - Also called Oswell Fountain and Fountain of the Upper Zambesi or Lunga by Livingstone. Livingstone named the source, which he located south of the Katanga region (in the southern part of present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) in what is now Zambia, after William C. Oswell (1818-1893), an explorer and hunter, whom Livingstone met and travelled with in South Africa and who remained Livingstone\'s close friend.</p>

<p><strong>Source of the Zambesi River</strong> - Also called Palmerston Fountain and Fountain of the Liambai by Livingstone. Livingstone named the source, which he located south of the Katanga region (in the southern part of present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) in what is now Zambia, after Lord Palmerston (1784-1865), a former British Minister, whose anti-slavery policies Livingstone admired.</p>

<p><strong>Source(s) of the Nile River</strong> - Also called Fountains of the Nile, Fountains of the River of Egypt, Caput Nili, and Katanga Head Waters by Livingstone. The search for the source(s) of the Nile motivated the African expeditions of a number of important Victorian explorers. Although John H. Speke (1827-1864) visited and correctly claimed Lake Victoria as the principal source in 1858, many contemporaries doubted his claim, so the search continued. Livingstone, for instance, believed that the sources lay much farther to the south in either present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo or Zambia.</p>

<p><strong>Sources of the Lomami/Lomani and Lufira Rivers</strong> - Also called Young\'s and Bartle Frere\'s Fountains by Livingstone. Livingstone placed the sources of the Lomami/Lomani and Lufira Rivers, both of which he incorrectly linked to the Nile, three or four days\' travel time south of Katanga (a region in the southern part of present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo). He named the sources after, respectively, James Young (1811-1883), a Scottish industrialist who later became one of Livingstone\'s trustees, and British colonial administrator H. Bartle E. Frere (1815-1884).</p>

<p><strong>Victoria Falls</strong> - Major waterfall on the Zambezi River, located on the border of present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 1855, David Livingstone became the first European to visit to the waterfall, which he named after Queen Victoria.</p>

<p><strong>White Nile</strong> - The White Nile, which flows north from Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, which flows west from Ethiopia, are the two main tributaries of the Nile River and join together to form the main Nile River at present-day Khartoum, Sudan.</p>

<p><strong>Zambesi River</strong> - Also called Liambai or Upper Zambesi by Livingstone. Major river in south central Africa that rises in present-day Zambia, then flows east across the continent to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p><strong>Zanzibar, Tanzania</strong> - Island off the east coast of Africa. In the nineteenth century, the center of East Africa\'s Arab-Indian-African trading network, a major international depot, and the site of a notorious slave market.</p>

<p>The publication of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary reveals for the first time the original record of a remarkable and traumatic period in the life of David Livingstone, the celebrated British abolitionist, missionary, and explorer of Africa. The date of publication coincides almost exactly with the date Livingstone completed this diary in Central Africa 140 years ago. The original, previously unpublished text of the diary has remained inaccessible until now, due to the fragility of the paper and the near-illegible script. Thanks to cutting-edge spectral imaging and processing technology, the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> now makes all the surviving pages of the diary available through this electronic edition.</p>

<p>In 1871, David Livingstone spent five months stranded in a small village in the Congo called Nyangwe. He had run out of writing paper and had nearly run out of ink, so he improvised the materials for his diary by writing over an old copy of <em>The Standard</em> newspaper with ink made from the seeds of a local berry. On 15 July 1871, while still in Nyangwe, Livingstone witnessed a massacre of the local African population by Arab slave traders from Zanzibar. Some 400 or 500 Africans, the majority of them women, died in a single day – a scale of murder and death unprecedented in Livingstone’s experience.</p>

<p>The massacre horrified Livingstone, leaving him too shattered to continue his mission to find the source of the Nile. He traveled 240 miles from Nyangwe – violently ill most of the way – back to Ujiji, an Arab settlement on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Here, Henry Morton Stanley, a reporter sent by <em>The</em> <em>New York Herald</em> to locate Livingstone (who had been "missing" for several years and presumed dead) found the Scottish explorer and purportedly greeted him with the iconic words, "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"</p>

<p>The rest is history. The meeting – one of the most famous encounters in the nineteenth century – and Stanley’s published accounts of Livingstone’s crusade against slavery secured the latter a prominent and enduring place in the public imagination. The meeting also launched Stanley’s own career as an explorer and led him, ultimately, to found the Congo Free State on behalf of Leopold II, the King of Belgium.</p>

<p>Yet despite its significance, Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary – which chronicles both the months in Livingstone’s life leading up to the famous meeting and the Nyangwe massacre as it unfolds moment by moment before Livingstone’s eyes – has remained inaccessible to scholars and the public alike. The newspaper over which Livingstone wrote has deteriorated, and Livingstone’s improvised red ink has faded to the point of invisibility. From the time that the diary was returned to England after Livingstone’s death in Africa in 1873 to the present, it has not been possible to read and study Livingstone’s original words.</p>

<p>Today, the first phase of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> – a unique transatlantic collaboration between scholars, scientists and educational and archival institutions – has completed its work on the diary. The complete original text is now made available worldwide as a free online resource. The diary, as those who read it will soon discover, offers an astonishing glimpse into Livingstone’s conflicted thoughts and actions during the most crucial period in his life. Instead of the saintly hero of Victorian mythology, the individual who emerges from the pages of the diary is passionate, vulnerable, and deeply torn about the violent events developing around him.</p>

<p><strong><u>Bonus</u>:</strong> Study the original first edition of <a href="http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/1871diary/index.htm" target="_blank">Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary</a> (external link)</p>

<p>Together with the text of the diary, the project team is delighted to make available an exciting and rich array of complementary materials:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a <a href="/islandora/search?access=view_spectral">collection of processed spectral images</a> that digitally preserves all the pages of Livingstone’s 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries and includes full metadata, thereby allowing direct access to all the primary data on which this critical edition is based;</li>
	<li>a <a href="/spectral-imaging/three-versions-1871-field-diary">page that allows comparison</a> between the original 1871 Field Diary, the highly revised 1872 version found in the Unyanyembe Journal (Livingstone 1866-72), and the further revised version from the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874), the book posthumously produced by Livingstone’s friend, Horace Waller;</li>
	<li>critical, textual, and historical essays and notes; and</li>
	<li>a detailed <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-history-0">project history</a> that chronicles the fascinating journey of Livingstone’s words from the "rediscovery" of the faded diary in 2009 to its publication today as the first significant nineteenth-century British literary manuscript to be enhanced with spectral imaging and processing. The project history also provides download access to some 70 digital files produced in the course of the project that collectively provide an intimate and comprehensive look into the production of this critical edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result – for the first time – is full access to a significant Scottish manuscript and the addition of an important primary resource to the study of African history and the history of the British Empire.</p>

<p>David Livingstone, perhaps the best known missionary and explorer of the Victorian period, was born in 1813 to parents Neil and Agnes Livingstone. He began life in Blantyre, a small town near Glasgow on the river Clyde where the cotton mill was the major employer. Like many locals, Livingstone entered the factory when he was ten years old, working as a piecer with the job of repairing threads broken during cotton spinning.</p>

<p>Though Livingstone’s childhood has often been romanticized, conditions at the Blantyre Mill were severe. Run by Monteith, Bogle and Co., work began at 6am and continued until 8pm with 40 minutes for breakfast and 45 for dinner (Mullen 2013:19). The mill had among the longest working hours in Scotland and, moreover, employed a greater number of children than most others operating in the greater Glasgow area. Livingstone was part of a considerable “child labour force” at work in the industry (Mullen 2013:19).</p>

<p>The mill, however, did pay better than many and while there was considerable overcrowding in the local Shuttle Row tenements, housing was superior than it was in central Glasgow. The owners also helped to fund <a id="lle2" name="lle2"></a>the salary of the local Church of Scotland clergyman and provided education by supporting a school, which some – like Livingstone – were able to use to their advantage (Mullen 2013:21-22).</p>

<p>When he was 19, Livingstone had saved enough money to begin medical training at Anderson’s college in Glasgow. Following the example of Karl Gützlaff, he hoped to combine medicine and missionary endeavour as an overseas agent (Jeal 2013:14). Certainly, for parts of his career Livingstone functioned as an early medical missionary: although much work remains to be done on his medical contributions, Livingstone’s insights into febrile conditions and his emphasis on prophylactic medication are considered to be important interventions in the comprehension and treatment of malaria, Human African trypanosomiasis, and various other tropical diseases (Lawrence 2010b).</p>

<p>Moreover, what’s interesting about Livingstone’s medical practice is how remarkably varied it was, ranging across “obstetrics, ophthalmology, the removal of tumours, tuberculosis, and the treatment of venereal diseases” (Harrison 2013:73). While this was due to some extent to the demands of the situations he found himself working in, his approach also reveals the Scottish character of his medical education: it demonstrates the “progressive and practical use of a Scottish training that combined the roles of physician and surgeon,” careers which were still differentiated in the English system in the 1830s (Harrison 2013:73).</p>

<p>Indeed, it is important to recognise that Livingstone was shaped by a Scottish intellectual tradition, which he encountered in Glasgow and in his earlier reading. Like many Scottish missionaries of the nineteenth century, Livingstone was influenced “not simply by evangelical Christianity, but also by the intellectual milieu of the later Scottish Enlightenment” (Stanley 2014:157).</p>

<p>For instance, Livingstone was impressed as a youth by the philosopher and science writer, Thomas Dick, whose popular theological works enabled him to conclude “that religion and science are not hostile, but friendly to each other” (Livingstone 1857b:4). Dick’s understanding of scientific observation as an examination of divine revelation in nature undoubtedly impacted Livingstone’s later enthusiastic work as a field-naturalist (Astore 2004).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the “post-Enlightenment” environment – in which “Christian orthodoxy of a broadly Calvinistic kind” was combined “with an unequivocal commitment to empirical science” – influenced the cultural encounters that resulted from his missionary work and exploration (Stanley 2014:157). While Livingstone often concluded that various tribal practices were based on mistaken beliefs, the rigorous “scientific <a id="lle3" name="lle3"></a>methodology” that he inherited led him to produce detailed examinations of tribal beliefs and customs, and to attempt to locate them in their local context.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1838 Livingstone joined the London Missionary Society (LMS), a predominantly congregationalist organisation. He would later claim that it was the society’s non-denominational and “perfectly unsectarian character” that appealed to him (Livingstone 1857b:6). Following theological training in Chipping Ongar, Essex, and further medical studies in London, Livingstone was ready to enter the mission field.</p>

<p>He initially intended to go to China, but was prevented from doing so by the outbreak of the Opium Wars in 1839. Instead, he changed course to South Africa, having been enticed by the words of the celebrated missionary, Robert Moffat, who described the “smoke of a thousand villages” yet to be visited (Blaikie 1880:28).</p>

<p>In 1841, Livingstone arrived in South Africa where he would spend eleven years at various inland stations, chiefly as missionary to the Kwena under the leadership of Sechele. Sechele later became an influential figure in the Christianisation of southern Africa, seeking to reconcile the new religion with various traditional practices and beliefs (Parsons 1998:39-40).</p>

<p>During his time with the Kwena, Livingstone began to make journeys to the north, partly to improve his skills in the Setswana language and partly to look for sites for new mission stations. Enticed by tales of a lake in the interior and fuelled by a desire to reach Sebituane, the chief of the Kololo, Livingstone aspired to cross the Kalahari Desert. In 1849, with the help of William Cotton Oswell, he succeeded in doing so and made it to the shore of Lake Ngami. He would later receive a reward from the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) for this achievement.</p>

<p>Livingstone was increasingly entertaining the hope of opening the continent to the outside world, by finding a possible “highway” to the coast (Schapera 1961:131-138). Learning about a major river to the North, the Zambezi, he hoped it might provide a “key to the Interior” (Schapera 1961:139-140; Roberts 2004). With <a id="lle4" name="lle4"></a>Oswell, Livingstone reached the river in August 1851 and felt confirmed that this was the very highway he was looking for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Crossing the Continent (1852-56)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>It was at this point that Livingstone’s travels started in earnest. In 1852, he sent his family back to Britain so that he could embark on a serious exploration of the Zambezi. This expedition was undertaken in collaboration with the new chief of the Kololo, Sekeletu, the son of Sebituane. He agreed to supply Livingstone with goods in order to pioneer a trade route to Loanda, in Angola, on the west coast.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Livingstone’s journey was aided by his status as an “nduna” of Sekeletu, one whose authority came from a powerful chief (Ross 2002:89, 94). Moreover, Livingstone was very reliant on his African retinue as interpreters in regions that did not speak Setswana. While exploration has frequently been discussed as the endeavour of heroic individuals, in reality explorers were reliant on such “intermediaries” whose linguistic skills and local knowledge were essential to the success of European expeditions (Driver and Jones 2009:11; Kennedy 2013:163).</p>

<p>With his company of Kololo companions, Livingstone reached Loanda in May 1854 following a difficult journey that cost him all his trade goods. Although ill and exhausted, he refused to return to Britain. Dissatisfied with the route he had travelled, Livingstone resolved instead to determine if passage to the east coast would be more accessible. So he set out again, on a journey that would take him across the entire continent.</p>

<p>Returning first to Linyanti, Sekeletu once more decided to support Livingstone and equipped him with men and ivory for the journey. Shortly after embarking, his guides led him to the waterfall known locally in the Lozi language as “Mosi-oa-Tunya,” or “the smoke that thunders,” which he renamed Victoria Falls. During this expedition, Livingstone was fated to miss the Cabora Bassa rapids, which would later foil his plans to use the Zambezi as a highway to the interior. In March 1856, he arrived in Tete and proceeded to Quelimane on the Mozambique coast in May.</p>

<p>He was soon hailed as the first European to have ever crossed the entirety of Africa. While his achievement was considerable, the continent had, however, previously been traversed by Arab and African traders who followed a long pre-established network of transregional caravan routes. It was this spatial infrastructure <a id="lle5" name="lle5"></a>that that would facilitate the later travels of the Europeans involved in continental exploration (Rockel 2014:172).</p>

<p>On his return to Britain, Livingstone was presented with the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in recognition of his expedition. With his newfound fame, he also found himself pressed upon to write an account of his time in Africa. It was of course common for missionaries to produce narratives of their years overseas; in Victorian Britain missionary writing was an established and popular literary genre. Livingstone was thus urged to follow in the footsteps of his predecessors in the London Missionary Society, such as John Williams and Robert Moffat, who each wrote substantial volumes (Wingfield 2013:118).</p>

<p>Yet, to some extent Livingstone broke with LMS convention when he chose to publish with John Murray, a specialist not in missionary writing but in travel literature. Murray had been very keen to secure Livingstone’s account of his cross-continental expedition and eagerly offered him generous terms. He promised him an advance of 2000 guineas and “two thirds of the profits of every Edition” (Murray 1857a, also 1857b).</p>

<p>The book was expected to be a sensation and it certainly was: the first impression of 12,000 copies sold out prior to publication in November 1857 and a second impression of 30,000 soon followed. For the first time in his life, Livingstone was wealthy: the sales made him over £8,500 (Roberts 2004).</p>

<p>While <em>Missionary Travels</em> was written at speed, the book was a truly impressive achievement. As a hybrid text – missionary narrative, travelogue, and work of field science – it had considerable breadth and substantial appeal. In contrast to many other explorers, moreover, Livingstone’s descriptions of Africans were strikingly sympathetic.</p>

<p>In writing his book, Livingstone’s primary aim was to direct public attention to central and southern Africa, which he presented optimistically as an “inviting field” for mission work and trade (Wisnicki 2009:257). It offered him the chance to advocate a combination of Christianity, commerce and civilisation and to encourage British intervention in the continent. Undoubtedly Livingstone’s attractive, almost “utopian” vision and his major literary success, contributed to his fame and his lasting reputation (Holmes 1993:351).</p>

<p><em>Missionary Travels</em> was a good investment for John Murray. He secured one of the best-selling travel books of the age. Yet Livingstone was not always the easiest author to work with. When it came to illustrating the book, his frequent requests for minor alterations frustrated Joseph Wolf, the artist whom Murray assigned to the publication (Koivunen 2001:6). Livingstone also resented editorial intrusion, complaining to his publisher about the interference of one editor whose changes threatened to “emasculate” his writing. He would, Livingstone told Murray, tolerate no sign of “namby pambyism” (Livingstone 1857a).</p>

<p><em>Missionary Travels</em> is also interesting for what it leaves out. In the original handwritten manuscript of the book, for instance, Livingstone had included a substantial critique of the Cape Frontier Wars, in which he criticised colonial violence at length. Perhaps in fear of alienating the establishment, or perhaps at Murray’s prompting, this passage – running to almost thirty pages – is excluded from the published text (Livingstone 2011; Livingstone 2014).</p>

<p>While at home, Livingstone was in demand as a guest speaker. He was not only a celebrated missionary and geographer: he was also now a celebrity. Although he found public speaking difficult, he gave numerous addresses about his work and future plans, notably at the British Association for the Advancement of Science <a id="lle6" name="lle6"></a>in Dublin and at the University of Cambridge. He received honorary degrees from the Universities of Oxford and Glasgow, and was elected to the Royal Society.</p>

<p>In March 1858, after fifteen months in Britain, Livingstone again set sail for Africa. While home, he had relentlessly emphasised the commercial possibilities of the continent and the potential for “legitimate commerce” to combat slavery (Livingstone 1857b:92). Now a celebrated national hero, Livingstone received substantial support for his plans. Financial backing for his next expedition was soon raised by public subscription and he was also awarded a sum of £5000 from the British government. Having now parted ways with the London Missionary Society, Livingstone returned to Africa as a British consul, leading a team of six Europeans with a mandate to evaluate the possibilities for British trade on the Zambezi (Roberts 2004).</p>

<p>The original plan was to reach the Zambezi delta, travel to the Batoka highlands, and from there explore the area and catalogue its natural resources (Dritsas 2010:11). The expedition, however, faced difficulties from the start. Relations among the group were strained, in part due to Livingstone’s shortcomings as a leader: several members either resigned from the expedition or found themselves dismissed. After investing such hopes in the Zambezi, there was considerable disappointment when further investigation of the Cabora Bassa rapids proved them to be impassable.</p>

<p>The whole expedition had rested on the navigability of the river, and so Livingstone was forced to consider other areas in the search for his highway to the interior. Now, his attention would fall on the Shire River, Lake Nyassa, and the Rovuma. Even though the original plans had proven unworkable, the government permitted the expedition to be extended beyond the original two years that had originally been approved.</p>

<p>Throughout the expedition, navigation was never easy. The water was often too low to permit passage, and Livingstone felt that his problems stemmed from steamboats that were poorly designed. The expedition also faced difficulties from other quarters. The encroachment of slave raiders into the Shire highlands and inter-tribal conflict created an increasingly unstable environment (Roberts 2004; Dritsas 2010:3). While Livingstone managed to explore a considerable portion of Lake Nyassa, which he called the “lake of stars” (Ross 2002:143), these conditions prevented him from ever reaching its northern end. The failure to circumnavigate and fully survey the lake was a major disappointment to British geographers (Dritsas 2010:17).</p>

<p>At the same time, Livingstone’s hopes for a mission in Central Africa were frustrated. Inspired by the emotive lectures that he gave in Britain, the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) had sent a party to establish a mission in 1861. While not directly connected to the expedition, they looked to Livingstone for support and advice. They eventually settled in Magomero, a Manganja village in the Shire highlands.</p>

<p>However, the mission became embroiled in tumultuous local politics (Roberts 2004). Many of the members also suffered from illness and died of fever. Following the death of the mission’s leader, Bishop Charles Mackenzie, the mission was withdrawn much to Livingstone’s disappointment. Likewise, a mission to the Kololo sent out by the LMS at Livingstone’s encouragement also ended in disaster and the deaths of almost the entire party.</p>

<p>The tragedy during the expedition, moreover, was personal for Livingstone. His wife, Mary, had come out to join him in 1862, but died shortly afterwards at Shupanga. In July 1863, the expedition was recalled to Britain. After a short excursion to the area west of Lake Nyassa, Livingstone began to return home. In a daring journey, he sailed his boat, the Lady Nyassa, across the Indian Ocean to Bombay, before boarding a ship to Britain.</p>

<p>In light of the many difficulties, it is no surprise that the Zambezi Expedition has often been deemed a failure: it certainly failed to meet the tremendous expectations of many supporters at home. Yet this reputation has obscured the fact as a scientific expedition – understood as “an aggregate of projects” with a range of <a id="lle7" name="lle7"></a>objectives and aspirations – it had some profitable results and various important botanical and zoological specimens were returned to Kew Gardens and the Natural History Museum (Dritsas 2010:3, 24, 34).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Second Return to Britain (1864-65)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>When Livingstone returned to Britain, his reception was more subdued than it had been in 1856-8. Some supporters had become disillusioned and this was compounded by the vocal criticisms of several members of the expedition. The decline in Livingstone’s reputation, however, has sometimes been overstated. Livingstone remained in the public eye and actually continued to be largely well received (MacKenzie 2013:283). On a visit to Inverary in 1864, for instance, at the invitation of the Duke of Argyll, he experienced a particularly enthusiastic welcome by the local community (Ross 2005:95).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in <em>A Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi</em> (1865), the book Livingstone co-wrote with his brother Charles, he clearly set out to defend his reputation. He certainly aimed to deflect the criticism he had received over the deaths of the LMS and UMCA missionaries. With accusations that he had neglected the UMCA mission circulating, for instance, Livingstone made sure to emphasise that although it was "entirely distinct" from his own expedition, he had felt "anxious to aid our countrymen in their noble enterprise" and had made it his duty to ensure the party was settled safely (Livingstone and Livingstone 1865:350).</p>

<p>Moreover, since he had been accused of embroiling Mackenzie in local conflicts, Livingstone felt obliged to insist that he had warned the Bishop not to "interfere in native quarrels": while Livingstone had sympathy with Mackenzie’s actions, he was keen to point out that unwarranted "blame was thrown on Dr. Livingstone’s shoulders, as if the Missionaries had no individual responsibility for their subsequent conduct" (Livingstone and Livingstone 1865:363). However, although the book served as a "vindication of Livingstone’s leadership" (Clendennen 1989:34; Martelli 1970:237), it was chiefly designed as a manifesto to mobilise and intensify British opposition to the slave trade.</p>

<p>While in Britain, Livingstone also used his time to lay plans for his return to Africa. This time, at the prompting of Roderick Murchison, the President of the RGS, he was to examine the water system of central Africa by exploring the terrain between Lake Nyassa and Lake Tanganyika (Wisnicki 2011). The hope was also that he might finally settle the age-old question of the source of the Nile, proving others like John Hanning Speke to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he still viewed himself as a missionary. He had an extended concept of the missionary <a id="lle8" name="lle8"></a>enterprise, and the expedition offered him the chance to continue using exploration to try and advance Christianity, commerce and civilisation, and bring about the end of the slave trade (Wisnicki 2011).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Livingstone was now appointed “Roving Consul” in central Africa, a title that came with no salary. Financial support from the government was limited for this new plan: only £500 was forthcoming. His old university friend James “Paraffin” Young, however, provided much needed assistance by contributing £1000. As a result, Livingstone had some financial backing, but its limited extent ensured that the venture would be on a much smaller scale this time.</p>

<p>In contrast to the previous expedition, on this occasion Livingstone would not be accompanied by other Europeans. In Bombay he recruited a number of Africans from mission schools as well as a contingent of sepoys. In Zanzibar he added to his retinue by recruiting an additional ten “Johanna men,” his name for porters from the Comoro Islands working in east Africa (Ross 2002:260). Only five from this original group would remain throughout the duration of his travels.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s final journeys lasted seven years, during which he passed through&nbsp;vast regions of east and central Africa, which would today include Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Wisnicki 2011). Early in 1867, his chronometers were damaged which led to subsequent errors in his longitudinal observations. He also struggled with depleted medical supplies, local wars, and the challenge of securing goods from Zanzibar.</p>

<p>Thanks to his travels, he developed a complex theory of the central African river system, arguing for three “lines of drainage” that connected to the Nile (Wisnicki 2011; Jeal 2013:323). In order to prove his theory, <a id="lle9" name="lle9"></a>which was ultimately incorrect, he set his eyes on the Lualaba river which he thought might feed the Nile. He feared, however, as was indeed the case, that it was really part of the Congo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Final Journeys (1869-72): Nyangwe Massacre and the Encounter with Stanley</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>In July 1869, Livingstone set out from Ujiji, a trading depot on Lake Tanganyika with the goal of reaching and tracing the Lualaba. After an arduous journey that lasted until March 1871, he reached the bank of the river at a village called Nyangwe. Prevented from securing canoes to explore the river, Livingstone remained there for several months. While he enjoyed visiting the market regularly and questioning the locals about the surrounding geography, the inability to travel further proved a frustrating experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to note that in Livingstone’s "last journeys," from 1866, he had been extremely reliant on the assistance of Arab-Swahili traders. The extent of the pre-existent trade network ensured encounters with their caravans, while regular illness and a lack of supplies often rendered him dependent on their goodwill. Although a committed abolitionist, Livingstone actually developed good relationships with a number of traders – notably travelling with one of the most celebrated and infamous Zanzibaris, Tippu Tip (Ross 2002:209).</p>

<p>In June, however, while at Nyangwe, Livingstone witnessed a massacre of the local Manyema market perpetrated by slave traders in the region. The circumstances that led to the massacre are complex, and Livingstone’s diaries and journals show considerable confusion about the events that triggered the attack (Wisnicki 2011). It is estimated that between three hundred to four hundred people were killed, with a majority being the women who usually attended the market.</p>

<p>Although Livingstone had considerable exposure both to the slave trade and its attendant conflicts, this experience proved particularly traumatic (Wisnicki 2011). Indeed, his accounts of the massacre, which would later circulate widely in Britain, provided an inspiration to other Victorian abolitionists who would lobby intensively for an anti-slavery treaty between Britain and Zanzibar (Helly 1987:26: Ross 2002:220-21).</p>

<p>The Nyangwe massacre also directly affected Livingstone’s plans. Horrified by the experience, he now decided to retreat to Ujiji where he planned to recuperate. There, he discovered to his regret that the goods that had been sent to him from the coast by John Kirk had been squandered and that he was consequently short of supplies. The return to Ujiji, however, paved the way for one of the most important meetings of Livingstone’s career. In early November 1871, Henry Morton Stanley entered the town bearing the flag of the United States and supposedly greeted Livingstone with the now famous question, "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"</p>

<p>Stanley was in pursuit of a “scoop” and his success in tracking down Livingstone for an exclusive interview became an international news story, reported on both sides of the Atlantic (Pettitt 2007:95; Rubery 2009:147).&nbsp;The young New York Herald journalist also brought much needed relief to the destitute explorer. During the months that Stanley and Livingstone subsequently spent together, they explored the northern end of Lake Tanganyika. Later, Stanley’s skillful negotiation of <a id="lle10" name="lle10"></a>the media and his bestselling book – <em>How I Found Livingstone&nbsp; </em>(1872) – served to consolidate Livingstone’s celebrity and helped to shape the way in which he would be remembered by future generations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Livingstone’s Death and Burial (1872-73)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Despite Stanley’s attempts to persuade Livingstone to return to Britain, the latter refused to do so. Instead, after being sent fresh supplies and new porters, Livingstone continued on his mission to establish the source of the Nile and journeyed to the south-eastern side of Lake Tanganyika and Lake Bangweulu. However, he became increasingly ill with fever, anal bleeding, and excruciating back pain, and eventually became too weak to walk unsupported. At the end of April 1873 he died in the village of Chitambo (present-day Chipundu, Zambia).</p>

<p>Following Livingstone’s death, the remaining members of his caravan made the decision to transport his remains to Bagamoyo on the east African coast. After disinterring and embalming the body, they set off on a journey lasting five months and covering over a thousand miles. Again, this considerable expedition is a reminder that the intermediaries with whom Livingstone and other explorers journeyed were accomplished travellers in their own right. The skills they possessed were of such value that some of them – including Jacob Chuma, who accompanied Livingstone – were regularly sought out by European explorers to participate in their expeditions (Kennedy 2013:170).</p>

<p>When Livingstone’s body reached the coast, it was shipped to Britain, arriving in Southampton on 15 April before being sent on to London. While he was already famed across Britain, the circumstances of his death and the transcontinental journey of his remains further captured the national imagination: for the Victorians, Livingstone embodied heroic ideals and had died the death of a martyr.</p>

<p>Under pressure from the public, and from interest groups like the RGS, the government prepared a stately funeral at Westminster Abbey on 18 April (Wolffe 2000:139-40; Lewis 2007; Livingstone 2012). The astonishing expression of grief that the event provoked indicates the extent to which Livingstone took on the status of a sort of “protestant saint” (MacKenzie 1992:124): indeed, his powerful symbolism would allow <a id="lle11" name="lle11"></a>others, well into the twentieth century, to invoke his name for a range of missionary, political, and imperialist purposes (MacKenzie 1990, 1996; Livingstone 2014)</p>

<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, southern Africa was a region characterised by intense conflict. The scale of this conflict had increased over the course of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, resulting in significant demographic shifts among the region’s population groups. In order to understand why, it is necessary to trace the history of human settlement in the African sub-continent from the pre-colonial period.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">The Earliest Inhabitants</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The earliest inhabitants of southern Africa were the San, or Bushmen, who were descendants of Late Stone Age peoples. Over the course of several thousand years, the San came to pursue their nomadic lifestyle across the region, from the south-west to the north-east.</p>

<p>With their primary mode of subsistence being hunting and gathering, and with their social organisation taking the form of small, kin-related groups, the San were highly mobile and adaptable to the changing environments of the sub-continent.</p>

<p>Following the San, were the Khoekhoe, who settled in southern Africa approximately 2500 years ago. The Khoekhoe supplemented their hunting and gathering with pastoralism. Unlike the San, the Khoekhoe tended to be more settled and the ownership of cattle and other livestock served as an important marker of status and authority.</p>

<p>Khoekhoe groups sustained larger numbers than the San and tended to follow hereditary "chiefs."&nbsp;By the sixteenth century, Khoekhoe polities, such as the Hessequa, Nama and Attaqua, came to occupy most of the region south of the Gariep River (Orange River) and west of the Fish River.</p>

<p>From 1100 CE onwards, during the Middle Iron Age, Bantu-speakers moved south from central Africa’s Great Lakes region in a series of migrations. There is also evidence of waves of migration from the west coast, around present-day northern Angola.</p>

<p>The Bantu-speakers practiced mixed-subsistence farming and tended to form socially complex communities. Some of these communities became kingdoms, eventually developing into small African states. Examples of such kingdoms include Mapungubwe and Great Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>By 1600 CE two Bantu-speaking branches had established themselves in present-day South Africa. The Nguni came to settle along the eastern coastal belt while the Sotho-Tswana settled across the eastern highland.</p>

<p>Both groups sought out reliable rainfall and soils suited to crop agriculture in order to sustain their agro-pastoral way of life. In addition to agriculture, their subsistence and economic activities included herding, hunting and trading.</p>

<p>Human settlement in southern Africa thus reflects the region’s climatic conditions. The eastern half of southern Africa has a high summer rainfall pattern, while the western half is much drier and often experiences drought.</p>

<p>In contrast to the rest of the region, the south-western Cape has a Mediterranean climate, characterised by wet winters and dry summers. The south-western Cape is also free of malaria and tsetse fly.</p>

<p>The quality of the south-western Cape’s climate was not lost on those European sea-faring nations who sailed around the southern tip of Africa in a bid to plot a sea route to the East. The Portuguese were the first to accomplish the feat and by the mid-sixteenth century the Cape of Good Hope’s strategic position on the trade route to Asia began to draw more Europeans to the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the mercantilist Dutch East India Company, or Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC), that first settled at Table Bay. In 1652 a fort was built and a small trading port established at the site. These were the rudimentary beginnings of the modern city of Cape Town.</p>

<p>At first the VOC did not intend to colonize the region, but rather focused on supplying passing ships with fresh produce and meat. Being a convenient half-way stop on the Europe-to-Asia sea route, the demand for life-saving, scurvy-preventing supplies was high. In 1657, Dutch immigrants, known as burghers, were allowed to settle and farm on the outskirts of the port settlement, providing the VOC with fruit, vegetables, wine and beer for sale to ships’ crews.</p>

<p>The trading port grew rapidly and so did the demand for labour, which was in short supply. In order to address this, slaves were first imported to Cape Town in 1658. The slave population was eclectic in origin. They came from numerous places along the Indian Ocean rim, including Java, the Malay Peninsula, Ceylon, Madagascar, and the east African coast.</p>

<p>Initially, the VOC bartered and traded with the Khoekhoe for their large herds of cattle and sheep. However, the VOC’s demand for livestock grew to such an extent that it began to place strain on several Khoekhoe polities. As more and more European migrant stock farmers, also known as trekboers, advanced into the interior, so conflict with Khoekhoe and San (Khoesan) over the land and its resources ensued.</p>

<p>European encroachment to the north and east of Cape Town was steady over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in spite of concerted Khoesan resistance. The loss of land and livestock, coupled with the introduction of European diseases, in particular smallpox, resulted in the rapid disintegration of Khoekhoe social and political organisation.</p>

<p>The San were treated with particular disdain by the trekboers, who regarded their hunter-gatherer lifestyle as backward and uncivilized. Conflict along the north-eastern frontier culminated in a genocidal campaign of extermination against the San during the 1770s and 1780s.</p>

<p>For the trekboers, the most fertile land lay to the east of Cape Town. With its high rainfall and numerous rivers, the Eastern Cape had also appealed to the Xhosa, the southernmost, Bantu-speaking agro-pastoralists. Conflict between the two quickly followed. From 1779 to 1879, nine frontier wars were fought between the Xhosa and the Cape Colony.</p>

<p>In 1795, the VOC was facing bankruptcy. In a bid to prevent post-revolutionary France from acquiring a foothold at the strategic Cape, Great Britain captured the territory in the same year. Britain was better equipped and more determined to impose its own vision on the Cape than the VOC had been.</p>

<p>The importation of slaves to Cape Town was abolished in 1807 and settler immigration from Britain also increased, especially after 1820. For much of the early nineteenth century, the British colonial authorities at the Cape were influenced by humanitarian ideas stemming from the evangelical revival at home and the anti-slavery campaign.</p>

<p>Slave reforms were introduced during the 1820s and early 1830s, curbing the authority masters held over their slaves, as Britain moved towards the eventual abolition of slavery in its colonial territories. These reforms were hugely unpopular with the Boer slave-owners of the Cape. In 1834 a four year period of apprenticeship was ushered in before the slaves were finally emancipated on 1 December 1838.</p>

<p>With the British occupation, the Cape Colony also emerged as an inviting mission field. In 1799, the London Missionary Society (LMS) despatched its first group of missionaries to the region.</p>

<p>The two earliest missions were founded among the Xhosa in the east and among the San to the north. Both missions were short-lived, but this did not deter other missionaries and mission societies from following. Subsequently, the Rhenish, Glasgow, Wesleyan and Paris societies entered the southern African mission field.</p>

<p>Between 1799 and the 1840s, several hundred missionaries arrived and eighty mission stations were established in the Cape Colony as well as beyond its official boundaries. The favourable climate, together with the success the missionaries experienced among the remnants of the Khoekhoe, resulted in the Cape having the highest concentration of missionaries in the world by the mid-nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Though preceded by the Moravians, the LMS would become the most prolific mission society at the Cape. They would also become the most politically instigative, campaigning for indigenous rights on behalf of the Khoesan and Xhosa via their evangelical-humanitarian networks.</p>

<p>The mission effort to promote the protection of African rights was set in motion by the earliest representatives of the LMS at the Cape, such as Johannes van der Kemp and James Read. Livingstone would take up this mantle and become one of the most famous champions of the cause later in the century.</p>

<p>For as long as Britain’s colonial authorities in London and Cape Town endorsed humanitarian principles, the missionaries were influential in shaping relations between the Cape’s indigenous, slave and settler inhabitants. During the 1820s and 1830s, the evangelical-humanitarian lobby’s influence on colonial affairs was at its height.</p>

<p>Major liberal reforms were introduced at the Cape that were intended to improve Khoesan labour conditions and restrict the power of the European settlers over both their servants and slaves. The abolition of slavery in 1834 was followed by the House of Commons Select Committee on Aborigines in 1836 and the founding of the Aborigines’ Protection Society the following year.</p>

<p>The Select Committee on Aborigines heard evidence on the devastating effects of settler colonialism upon indigenous peoples in British territories, including New South Wales, Van Dieman’s Land (Tasmania), New Zealand and the Cape Colony. The Boers were criticised for their treatment of the Khoesan and for instigating wars with the Xhosa along the eastern frontier, raising their indignation against Britain’s rule at the Cape.</p>

<p>The combination of labour reforms and the abolition of slavery resulted in large numbers of Boers, known as Voortrekkers, voluntarily opting to leave the Cape Colony. Several thousand trekked further northwards into the southern African interior in order to escape British interference and to establish their own states.</p>

<p>The ensuing migrations are commonly referred to as the Great Trek. By the early 1850s, the Voortrekkers were able to secure British recognition of their new Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, also known as the Zuid Afrika Republiek.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the southern African interior escarpment, or Highveld, had witnessed a significant political revolution among the area’s Bantu-speaking peoples. At first gradual, by the early nineteenth century this revolution sparked rapid demographic shifts and even the de-populating of some parts of the region.</p>

<p>The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was a period of widespread internecine conflict among the Sotho-Tswana and Nguni peoples of southern Africa. These waves of conflict, forced migration and socio-political consolidation are referred to as the Mfecane, meaning "the crushing,"&nbsp;or "the scattering."</p>

<p>The ripple effect of the Mfecane covered a vast geographical area. Conflicts between competing groups stretched from the Eastern Cape frontier all the way to present-day Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The reasons for the Mfecane are contested among historians, but several influences have been identified.</p>

<p>The introduction of maize around this time meant that some groups were able to sustain larger numbers. However, maize requires large amounts of water. Evidence of a severe drought in the southern African interior at the turn of the nineteenth century suggests that widespread hunger was a contributing factor to the Mfecane.</p>

<p>Christian missionaries were sought out for the protection and provision they could offer during these events. Displaced people tended to gather around mission stations. This did not, however, guarantee greater receptivity to the gospel, much to the frustration of many missionaries.</p>

<p>Another factor in the unfolding of the Mfecane was the demand for slaves and ivory emanating from Arab, Swahili and Portuguese traders on the East African coast, especially modern-day Mozambique. This resulted in the exchange of horses and firearms with inland communities and the emergence of powerful groups of slave and livestock raiders, such as the Korana.</p>

<p>The Korana were one of several Oorlam communities to emerge along the Trans-Gariep frontier during this period. Oorlam was a term used to refer to mixed race groups of Khoesan, slave, European and Sotho-Tswana commixture. The Korana were predominantly of Khoekhoe and Sotho-Tswana extraction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The early nineteenth century also witnessed the emergence of the Griqua as a dominant group along the northern frontier of the Cape Colony. The Griqua were made up of several pastoral communities with mixed Khoesan, slave and European ancestries.</p>

<p>With the aid of the LMS, the Griqua were organised into captaincies in the 1820s. They spoke Dutch and wore western-style clothing. Their geographic location, to the north of the Cape Colony and to the west of Delagoa Bay, meant they were well poised to take advantage of the expanding trade in guns, horses and slaves.</p>

<p>Increasing conflict&nbsp;over trade and resources led to the consolidation of smaller polities into larger "tribal"&nbsp;groups. In this context, leaders who were able to provide security and dispense patronage attracted more followers.</p>

<p>It was due to processes related to the Mfecane that some of southern Africa’s most prominent ethnicities and royal houses emerged, many of which still exist today. The Zulu kingdom under Shaka was one of the most significant.</p>

<p>Under Shaka’s leadership, several small Nguni groups along the eastern coastal belt were forcibly merged to form the Zulu, who today constitute South Africa’s most numerous population group. Shaka was an astute military tactician. He transformed the Zulu army, or impi, into a formidable force in the region.</p>

<p>Shaka’s military campaigns against neighbouring groups in what is today KwaZulu-Natal had a ripple effect across the interior. Groups were either absorbed into the Zulu or forced out of their territories.</p>

<p>Shaka was not responsible for the Mfecane, rather he was reacting to the Mfecane, which had begun several decades before his rise to power. Nonetheless, his influence was considerable and his reign as king of the Zulu ushered in a fresh, violent wave to the overall process.</p>

<p>By the late 1830s, the Mfecane was drawing to a close. Other prominent "tribal"&nbsp;groups that also emerged as a consequence included the Ndebele under Mzilikazi and the Sotho under Moshoeshoe, who went on to found the modern Kingdom of Lesotho.</p>

<p>The Voortrekkers added to the competition over land and resources after their arrival on the Highveld and the eastern coastal belt in the late 1830s. Major battles between the Voortrekkers and the Zulu and Ndebele occurred.</p>

<p>The newly consolidated African polities also fought with each other, often raiding livestock and capturing slaves for sale at Delagoa Bay and to the Voortrekkers. Alliances of convenience were struck up between groups as well. A notable case in point was the Griqua-Voortrekker alliance which clashed with the Ndebele.</p>

<p>Some astute African leaders realised that missionaries could be useful political allies. Missionaries could act as intermediaries with colonial authorities, provide counsel and facilitate trade, even of guns and horses. For example, Moshoeshoe consulted missionaries sent by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society on the threat posed by Voortrekker encroachment on Sotho lands.</p>

<p>Major demographic shifts continued to characterise southern Africa for the remainder of the nineteenth century. The pace of change quickened following the discovery of diamonds in the 1860s and the world’s richest gold deposits in the Transvaal in the 1880s, ushering in the industrialisation of the region.</p>

<p>In 1850 there were approximately twenty independent societies occupying what is today South Africa. By the close of the century, this entire region was made up of the two Boer republics and the two British colonies, the Cape Colony and Natal. All the formerly independent Khoesan and Bantu-speaking societies fell under their control.</p>

<p>Following Livingstone’s arrival at the Cape in 1841, he travelled north to a region that was largely unexplored in a bid to find new locations for the establishment of missions. He was first based at Kuruman among the Tswana. Kuruman was one of the LMS’ flagship missions in southern Africa and it was administered by Robert Moffat, whose daughter, Mary, married Livingstone in 1845.</p>

<p>Livingstone interacted with other prominent LMS representatives at the Cape, such as the Society’s superintendent, John Philip. He was thrust into the heated debate between the LMS and settlers over the future of the Colony and its indigenous inhabitants.</p>

<p>More overtly racist sentiments began to take hold in Britain and her settler colonies from the 1840s onwards. Even though evangelical-humanitarians were being increasingly sidelined in imperial affairs, Livingstone carried on the LMS tradition of campaigning on behalf of Africans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Philip and others associated with the Aborigines’ Protection Society, Livingstone did not oppose British imperialism, but rather unchecked settler colonialism. He thought of British imperialism as a "civilizing"&nbsp;and "Christianizing"&nbsp;influence, whereas he regarded the settlers, in particular the Boers, with disdain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Livingstone arrived in southern Africa at a time when the region was reeling from major demographic upheaval, violent frontier conflicts and extensive slave-raiding. His early encounters and experiences were to influence his political views, as well as his choices of where to venture and to proselytise.</p>

The overarching goal of the project, under the leadership of Adrian S. Wisnicki, is to revise, redesign, and expand the original <em>Livingstone Online</em> website and digital collection (2005-13; Christopher Lawrence, original director and director emeritus of the present site).</p>

<p>The first three years of LEAP (1 September 2013 - 31 July 2016) have resulted in:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) the creation of the present site, released in a <a href="https://livingstoneonline.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/another-milestone-livingstone-online-launches-the-beta-site/" target="_blank">beta form</a> on 24 June 2015 and in a formal first edition form on 1 August 2016 (anticipated);</p>

<p class="rteindent1">2) the composition of a variety of supporting essays and other materials in the <a href="/about-this-site">About This Site</a>, <a href="/behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes</a>, and <a href="/resources">Resources</a> sections of the present site;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">3) the update and expansion of all <em>Livingstone Online</em> <a href="/life-and-times">critical materials</a>;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">4) the redevelopment and integration of <em>Livingstone Online</em>\'s legacy image data (5,000 manuscript images, 500 illustrative images), including the addition of Dublin Core metadata to all image headers;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">5) the addition of 1,400 new manuscript and illustrative images from the National Library of Scotland;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">6) the digitization of 3,600 manuscripts pages from the David Livingstone Centre and rigorous critical editing and transcription of some 2,200 of these pages;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">7) the release of a fully updated version of the <em>Livingstone Online</em> <a href="/his-own-words/livingstone-online-digital-collection">digital collection</a> consisting of over 1,100 items (8,000 images, 500 transcriptions), 3,000 metadata records, and downloadable archival packets for nearly all items in the collection;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">8) the development of a robust interface for our <a href="/islandora/search">digital catalogue</a> and a manuscript viewer that allows for dynamic study of all <em>Livingstone Online</em> core image and transcription data;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">9) a comprehensive set of <a href="http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-ODD/leap.html" target="_blank">transcription and encoding guidelines</a> for Livingstone manuscripts; and</p>

<p class="rteindent1">10) the completion of a pilot <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-outreach-program">outreach program</a> for schools and the production of a collection of <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-outreach-worksheets">digitized teaching resources</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/about-site/leap-2013-2016-project-history-part-i">LEAP (2013-2017): A Project History</a> details the work that went into achieving these objectives. Elsewhere on our site, users can also find a <a href="/behind-scenes/project-teams">list of the project team members</a> and download our <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-project-documents#lopd1.3">original NEH grant application</a> as well as a variety of <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-project-documents">other documents</a> produced in the course of our project.</p>

<p>The final year of the project (1 August 2016 - 31 August 2017) will result in:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) the integration of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>, including the multispectral critical edition of <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary</a>, into <em>Livingstone Online</em>; and</p>

<p class="rteindent1">2) a critical edition of Livingstone\'s final diaries and journals (1866-73), possibly the most comprehensive surviving collection of manuscript documents related to any single nineteenth-century British expedition to Africa.</p>

<p>During this period or soon thereafter, <em>Livingstone Online</em> will also support the publication of a multispectral critical edition of <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary-and-select-1871-letters">Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary and select 1871 letters</a> (Adrian S. Wisnicki, director), a critical edition of the Livingstone letters held in South Africa (Jared McDonald and Adrian S. Wisnicki, co-directors), and a critical edition of the manuscript of <em>Missionary Travels</em> (1857), Livingstone\'s first book (Justin Livingstone, director).</p>

<p>Collectively, these efforts – we hope – will result in the creation of a resource for the study of Livingstone\'s manuscript legacy, an important part of our shared global heritage, that survives long into the future.</p>

<p>David Livingstone composed the 1870 Field Diary and a handful or related manuscripts over various scraps of paper while stranded in Central Africa. Because of his immobility, Livingstone focused his writing on African life to an extent usual both for his final writings (1866-73) and those of contemporaneous British travelers to Africa. The documents capture Livingstone\'s first-hand impressions of the Central African slave trade,&nbsp;record complex social dynamics among local Central African populations, and set out detailed geographical information gathered through travel and by interviewing Arab and African informants.</p>

<p>Livingstone sent some of the manuscript back to Britain, but carried others – notably the 1870 Field Diary – with him until death in 1873 in present-day Zambia. Thanks to these vicissitudes, the manuscripts circulated through a variety of environments, passed through multiple hands, and, ultimately, survived to the present day in a handful of archives in Britain.</p>

<p>This critical edition uses advanced spectral imaging technology to recover the hidden production and preservation history of these manuscripts over the last 145 years. In doing so, our edition breaks new ground in the study of David Livingstone\'s manuscripts and, potentially, those of other nineteenth-century explorers and travel writers, particularly because the edition restores some of the lost hands and voices that helped shape the text as it survives today.</p>

<p>The edition also represents the culmination of the second phase (2013-17) of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>. The first phase of the project (2010-13) built on the pioneering work of the <a href="http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/" target="_blank">Archimedes Palimpsest Project</a>, the <a href="http://www.digitalgalen.net/" target="_blank">Galen Palimpsest Project</a>, and others to demonstrate that spectral image processing could recover faded text composed over nineteenth-century newspaper pages. The second phase takes the technology in a new direction by successfully showing that spectral imaging can also reveal significant material information about nineteenth-century manuscripts.</p>

<p class="space2">Spectral imaging relies on imaging an object, such as a manuscript, under multiple wavelengths of light, ranging from ultraviolet through the visible color spectrum to the near-infrared. A high-resolution monochromatic digital camera automatically photographs each illumination. Imaging scientists then manipulate this raw image data with computers by applying various processing algorithms with the goal of enhancing features of interest. Often the features are made more visible by creating pseudocolor (false-color) representations of the object that foreground or suppress other object features.</p>

<p>The text of the 1870 Field Diary is not difficult to read with the naked eye and so does not require spectral image processing for legibility like Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a> did. Rather a variety of other features make the 1870 Field Diary manuscript worth studying with processed spectral images, including a) Livingstone\'s decision to construct the diary out of multiple distinct printed and handwritten source texts, b) the presence of diverse inks and pencil marks (from Livingstone and others) on the diary\'s pages, c) unique elements of manuscript topography tied to events in the life of the diary, and d) environmental traces left on the diary\'s pages thanks to its complex history.</p>

<p>The second phase of our project, in contrast to the first, has therefore accomplished not one spectral image processing goal (the recovery of lost text), but several while producing a range of new spectral imaging techniques and <a href="/islandora/search/&quot;1870 Field Diary&quot; retrospect letters NOT beard?f[]=genre_ms%3A&quot;spectral+color&quot;" target="_blank">new processed spectral images</a>. The images offer insights into Livingstone’s creation of his text and the impact of both single moments and long-term processes in determining the manuscript’s current material state. These insights promise to enhance our understanding of the British empire, Victorian travel writing, Livingstone’s biography, and the history of the African cultures among which Livingstone worked and traveled. In using spectral imaging to analyze these features, we hope to open up new possibilities for the technological study of nineteenth-century manuscripts produced by British and other travelers around the globe.</p>

Because of the methods that Livingstone used, today much of these documents is illegible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Since 2010, however, we have applied spectral imaging and processing – a cutting-edge imaging technology first pioneered by NASA – to study these documents, examine manuscript features that cannot be seen in any other way, and, indeed, reveal text that has been hidden for 140 years. The National Endowment for the Humanities (USA) has cited <a href="http://50.neh.gov/projects/david-livingstone-goes-digital" target="_blank">this project</a> as one "that changed the landscape of the humanities" and has selected it as <a href="http://50.neh.gov/" target="_blank">one of 50 projects</a> to represent the best of the 65,000 projects that the NEH has funded since its inception 50 years ago.</p>

<p>In 1870 and 1871, David Livingstone\'s travels took him far into central Africa, west of Lake Tanganyika into what is today eastern Congo. There, due to illness, difficult environmental conditions, and the reluctance of local African populations to assist him, he became stranded. He stopped first in a village called Bambarre, where "flesh-eating ulcers on the feet" halted progress for many months. Then he reached Nyangwe, which lies on the right bank of a principal tributary of the Congo River but which, Livingstone hoped, might have some connection to the mythical "source" of the Nile.</p>

<p>As time passed, his supplies dwindled. First, Livingstone ran short of the small reporter\'s notebooks in which he recorded his field notes. So he started ripping pages out of the books he had with him and writing crosswise over the printed text. Next he turned to newspapers. Finally, he resorted to anything he had at hand – the back of a map, an envelope, any odd scrap of paper. Then he ran out of ink, so he turned the berries of a local plant, which he called "Zingifure" (today known as <em>bixa orellana</em>) to create a new reddish ink.</p>

<p>These expedients enabled him to keep writing. He described the tribes he met in Central Africa, none of whom had ever before seen a European. He wrote about local trade – visiting the periodic barter market in Nyangwe became one of his favorite ways to pass the time. He recorded vocabulary from local dialects he had never heard before. He noted sightings of unusual animals, including gorillas. Most importantly, Livingstone described some of the darkest months in his life – a period of isolation, when he believed that his friends and country had forgotten him, and when he witnessed a series of atrocities perpetrated by slave traders from Zanzibar. These atrocities culminated in a massacre in Nyangwe that left some 300-400 Africans dead in one day.</p>

<p>When the documents arrived in Britain in 1870s – some were carried by Henry Morton Stanley, some smuggled out by individuals among the slave traders sympathetic to Livingstone\'s abolitionist views, some returned only with Livingstone\'s body after his death in Africa – Livingstone\'s words proved difficult and, in some cases, impossible to decipher. To record this period in Livingstone\'s life, sympathizers released only partial and edited transcriptions of the documents or turned to alternate sources, which offered revisionary versions of Livingstone\'s original experiences in Africa.</p>

<p>A chance turn of events in 2009 brought the Livingstone spectral imaging team together and set them on the path to recovering the full text of these letters and diaries. The story of that work and its exciting results – which have also been the subject of "The Lost Diary of Dr. Livingstone," a documentary broadcast by <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/the-lost-diary-of-dr-livingstone-about-this-episode/1103/" target="_blank">PBS in the US</a> and <a href="http://www.natgeotv.com/za/the-lost-diary-of-dr-livingstone" target="_blank">National Geographic in the UK and Europe</a> – is detailed in this section of <em>Livingstone Online</em>.</p>

<p>Field Diary VII chronicles Livingstone’s journey westward through the Chikokwe Mountains and across the Movoche River (a tributary of the Loangwa River). The diary also represents the last of the field diaries from 1866; no other year of Livingsotne’s final travels (1866-73) will receive this much coverage. All the while, Livingstone is dogged by extreme hunger. What begins as an attempt to hunt a rhinoceros for Christmas dinner in face of the “exorbitant prices” of Kavimba’s village turns into a full-scale famine by the following month (Livingstone 1866f:[5]).</p>

<p>Livingstone attributes this food shortage, as in his previous diary, to the threat from the Mazitu people, as they often cannot buy food at villages due to widespread lack. The first half of the diary is necessarily concerned with getting enough food: methods for hunting elephants (which they cannot find), preparations for the maere (millet) porridge on which Livingstone and his men subsist, and attempts to outwit villagers who report no food for sale.</p>

<p>In the ensuing months, Livingstone writes, "it is hard fare and scanty. I feel always hungry &amp; dreaming of better food such as I have enjoyed" (1866f:[26]). His guide deserts due to the lack of food, and Livingstone\'s hunger reaches it peak after he runs completely out of food because he doled out more to his men than for himself. Fortunately, once they cross the Chambezi River at the end of January, they are once more in a "land of plenty - cows, sheep &amp; goats &amp; corn" though the hunger until then has left him a "a mere bundle of bones" (Livingstone 1866f:[62]). Livingstone does not comment on his men\'s condition.</p>

<p>Since Livingstone and his men now have adequate supplies of food, the second half of the diary is dominated by Livingstone\'s dealings with two chiefs. Livingstone remains at Chitapangwa\'s village for weeks, in part delayed by ill health but also by Chitapangwa\'s demands for cloth, blankets, and a box. Many pages of the diary record the back-and-forth between Livingstone and Chitapangwa as they negotiate Livingstone\'s safe passage.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Livingstones leaves on 20 February 1867, only to end up several days later in the village of Moamba, who is Chitapangwa\'s brother. There is further negotiation, but he remains only a week before "part[ing] good friends" and crossing the Merenge river (Livingstone 1866f:[109]). These pages testify both to Livingstone\'s negotiating skills and to his constant worry that he is being undermined in these negotiations by his men - or "cowardly" boys, as he calls them (Livingstone 1866f:[87]).</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s only encounter with slave traders in this diary occurrs at Chitapangwa\'s village. The traders are Arabs or, as Livingstone puts it, "blacks all," from Bagamoio; one of them previously traveled with the British explorer John Hanning Speke (Livingstone 1866f:[76]). Although he descries their profession and their allegiance to his rival Speke, Livingstone nonetheless sends them off with 17 letters, a long shopping list of supplies to be sent to Ujiji, and an order for them to be paid 10 rupees when they reach Zanzibar.</p>

<p>In between these main events, Livingstone records the death of his poodle, Chitane, by drowning while crossing a river, and the desertion of two Waiyau men, who take with them a number of Livingstone\'s provisions. Notes about local African cultures appear throughout, with a particular focus on conventions of dress and decoration, including many drawings. Livingstone and his men encounter heavy rain during this period, which makes for hard going, especially during the hungry month of January. These circumstances, however, do not diminish the production of notes on the surroundings, including elements of geography, rocks, and plants (especially orchids, rhododendrons, and gum copal trees).</p>

<p>Livingstone writes Field Diary VII in a notebook that differs from the first six. This green-covered notebook is bound at the top, so it flips open. Livingstone writes from top to bottom, covering both pages with the spine running horizontally across the middle. The book measures 141 mm high x 89 mm wide x 15 mm thick and inside the front cover are endpapers that announce "Letts, Son &amp; Co.\'s Metallic Books," and include tables of information, such as stamp duties, exchange rates, wages table, and weights and measures. Livingstone uses this new notebook in much the same way as the previous diaries, writing from both ends simultaneously.</p>

<p>The final 29 pages of this 140-page diary are upside-down and include extensive weather records, rain measurements, and geographical calculations. Multiple maps and descriptions describe his surroundings and multiple drawings illustrate local customs. There are also brief entries that correspond with longer descriptions of events in the front section, such as the slavers taking letters to Zanzibar or gum copal trees.</p>

<p>Other notes in this section, however, are not elaborated in the front section, such as a drawing and description of how to build a Makololo travelling shed (Livingstone 1866f:[131]). This suggests that Livingstone may have used the final section of this diary to make notes for possible longer entries, not all of which he chose to expand.</p>

<p>This edition of <em>Livingstone’s Letter from Bambarre</em> is of great interest to scholars of the British Empire, Victorian literature, African history, the history of medicine, and the digital humanities. Livingstone\'s previously unpublished letter of 5 February 1871 to his friend and future editor, Horace Waller, was the first nineteenth-century British literary work to be captured and enhanced with the multispectral imaging process.</p>

<p><a href="/spectral-imaging/introduction-spectral-imaging">Spectral imaging</a>, when used for the study of cultural objects, involves illuminating an object with successive wavelengths of light – starting with ultraviolet, working through the visible spectrum, and concluding with infrared – while capturing digital images and, later, processing the images in order to enhance select object features.</p>

<p>When originally published in 2010, <em>Livingstone’s Letter from Bambarre</em> set a new standard for the range of data that a digital edition of a nineteenth-century manuscript could contain, as the edition (reproduced here) included a full textual apparatus and bibliography, alongside natural light images and multispectral images processed to enhance text and topography.</p>

This page is the same one as above, but this image has been enhanced with spectral image processing to minimize the underlying printed text (page center) and to reveal Livingstone\'s writing.</span></p>

<p>The edition of the letter also served as the pilot phase for an eighteen-month spectral imaging project (2010-11) on <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary</a>, an iconic document that captures Livingstone\'s first-hand impressions of a horric slave-trading massacre in Central Africa and that documents the months leading up to his famous meeting with Henry M. Stanley.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone\'s Letter from Bambarre</em> laid the groundwork for the 1871 Field Diary project because analysis of the letter – which was composed by the same methods and during the same period as the diary – demonstrated that spectral imaging could be applied effectively to study nineteenth-century paper-based British manuscripts.</p>

<p><a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-central-africa-1870"><strong>Livingstone, Central Africa, 1870</strong></a> - shifts critical focus from biographical approaches centering on Livingstone in 1870 to the Central African cultural material found in the 1870 Field Diary; in doing so, argues that the diary’s innovative narrative style documents and, at times, foregrounds a regional universe whose complexity stands at odds with the reductive characterizations later imposed upon it by Livingstone and others.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">Creating the 1870 Field Diary</a></strong> - the first section of a six-part sequence; begins a comprehensive account of the 1870 Field Diary as a constructed and preserved object, and explores the initial steps in the creation of the diary.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/structuring-1870-field-diary">Structuring the 1870 Field Diary</a></strong> - the second section of a six-part sequence; continues a comprehensive account of the 1870 Field Diary as a constructed and preserved object; explores the structure that Livingstone (and, later, others) imposed on the text and discusses other prominent textual features.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1">The Diary across Hands, Space, and Time (1)</a></strong> - the third section of a six-part sequence; uses the presence of ink and pencil on the pages of the manuscript to explore the role of Livingstone and others in composing the text of the diary.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2">The Diary across Hands, Space, and Time (2)</a></strong> - the fourth section of a six-part sequence; uses manuscript topography as a means to illuminate how handling by a variety of individuals has helped shape the present material state of the manuscript.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3">The Diary across Hands, Space, and Time (3)</a></strong> - the fifth section of a six-part sequence; examines how the many environments through which the diary has circulated have left their marks on its pages; also includes a brief discussion of notable material features of the manuscript not covered in the previous sections.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/spectral-imaging/history-chronology-1870-field-diary">History &amp; Chronology of the 1870 Field Diary</a></strong> - the sixth section of a six-part sequence; summarizes the previously documented history of the diary and, by using findings from this edition, develops a comprehensive new chronology of the manuscript.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> started as a pilot project with a broader aim. In 2004, a small group of scholars at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London began to investigate the ways in which nineteenth-century medicine and science advanced the nationalist aims of exploration and colonization.</p>

<p>In particular, while pursuing an interest in the history of surgery, Professor [qtip: Chris Lawrence|Chris Lawrence (Professor Emeritus, University College London). Former director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>; now director emeritus of the project.] realized that nineteenth-century surgeons often relied on strategies of self-representation that mirrored those used by nineteenth-century explorers. For instance, both sets of men (they were usually men) sought to portray themselves as masculine heroes, as individuals entering “unknown territory,” and so forth. Lawrence, therefore, hoped to launch a more extended comparison of the two groups.</p>

<p>The preliminary <em>Livingstone Online</em> team consisted of Lawrence as director, associate director [qtip: Janet Browne|Janet Browne (Aramont Professor of the History of Science, Harvard University). Former associate director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>; now senior advisor to the project.], research assistants [qtip: Sharon Messenger|Sharon Messenger (Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine, University College London). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] and [qtip: Caroline Overy|Caroline Overy (Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine, University College London). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], and programmer [qtip: Michael Hawkins|Michael Hawkins (University of Sussex). Web developer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.]. The team sought to design and build an online scholarly resource that conformed to academic electronic publishing best practices and that offered its users something more than a traditional, print-based resource. The resource would include rigorous transcriptions and high-resolution images of original archived materials along with editorial annotations and text searching capabilities. The team decided to focus on letters from English-speaking, nineteenth- and twentieth-century explorers, particularly those with connections to medicine and science.</p>

<p>To test the feasibility of this larger project (tentatively titled “Medicine and Exploration”), the team determined to examine the medical and scientific content of the 2,000+ letters that David Livingstone had written during his life and to investigate how this content could be made accessible. Preliminary research showed that there was no definitive edition of David Livingstone’s letters: a few were published in scholarly format; others were unpublished or published in incomplete or poorly edited forms. There was, however, an invaluable catalogue of the letters and other manuscripts and their locations. In addition, a number of particularly well known libraries and archives in Britain and Africa had substantial holdings of original Livingstone material.</p>

<p>The team chose to confine the project to letters because of the special relationship of letters to the private and public realms, and because of the role letters played in linking the metropolitan center and the colonial field. In particular, the team took interest in how the edited letters would illuminate the use of western medicine and science in South and Central Africa in the nineteenth century, both as practical tools of exploration and as cultural instruments of colonization.</p>

<p>The pilot phase of <em>Livingstone Online</em> began on 1 August 2005, thanks to a grant from the Wellcome Trust, and the site went live on 5 May 2006 publishing a selection of nearly 70 Livingstone letters from the Wellcome Trust Library as well as a handful from the National Library of Scotland. These letters had been chosen because they were relatively short and so offered the team, many of whom were new to electronic publishing, the opportunity to develop the appropriate skills in a fairly controlled environment. University College London agreed to host the site, while the project itself took up headquarters at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine.</p>

<p>After the success of the pilot project, the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team shifted its overriding goal to publishing a wide range of Livingstone letters. This decision arose from recognizing that Livingstone\'s manuscripts offered an ideal source for studying the integration of science and medicine into the colonizing process and, more practically, from a decision to develop the project in a way that funding bodies would find feasible and so support. Indeed, during this time the team successfully applied to the Wellcome Trust for a substantial three-year grant. [qtip: Gary Li|Gary Li. Photographer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] joined the team as photographer, and a new phase of the project launched in January 2007.</p>

<p class="space1" style="line-height:110%"><a href="/sites/default/files/about-this-site/brief-history-livingstone-online-2004-2013/liv_013284_0001-article.jpg"><img alt="Sharon Messenger and Caroline Overy at the Wellcome Library, 2008.

<p>A different goal determined the work for each year of this new grant. In the first year, the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team planned to identify the key Livingstone medical and scientific letters at the National Library of Scotland and to transcribe, edit, and publish each of these as well as all 40 Livingstone letters at the David Livingstone Centre, Glasgow. During the second year, the team hoped to turn to other UK libraries and archives with significant Livingstone holdings: including SOAS, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Rhodes House Library, Oxford. The team set aside the third year for the collection of relevant Livingstone materials from archives with smaller collections including libraries abroad. During these years, the team also planned to convert and update the Clendennen and Cunningham catalogues (1979, 1985) into an integrated, searchable, online database.</p>

<p>A series of key developments, therefore, marked this phase of the project. In February 2007, <em>Livingstone Online</em> established an advisory board that balanced scholarly, archival, and technical expertise and that consisted of [qtip: Pietro Corsi|Pietro Corsi (Professor, University of Oxford). Advisory board member for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], [qtip: Felix Driver|Felix Driver (Professor, Royal Holloway, University of London). Advisory board member for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], [qtip: Mark Harrison|Mark Harrison (Professor, Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine, University College London). Advisory board member for Livingstone Online.], [qtip: Rob Iliffe|Rob Iliffe (Professor, University of Sussex). Advisory board member for Livingstone Online.], and [qtip: Murray Simpson|Murray Simpson (Manager of Manuscript Collections, University of Edinburgh Library). Advisory board member for Livingstone Online.]. In December 2007, the team released the online version of the Clendennen and Cunningham catalogues. Concurrently, <em>Livingstone Online</em> published images and/or transcriptions of the Livingstone holdings from a succession of institutions: the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow; the Royal Society; the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts (RSA); the National Library of Scotland; the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; the John Murray Archive; the John Rylands Library; and the Royal Geographical Society. Regular announcements and, later, a blog kept the public apprised of project developments.</p>

<p>By the end of the three-year grant phase in 2009, the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team could claim a number of accomplishments. The team had developed a robust website supported by a well-developed database. <em>Livingstone Online</em> had published nearly 500 Livingstone manuscript items as either rigorous transcriptions and/or high-resolution images and, moreover, had collected several hundred images and a large number of transcriptions yet to be put online. Finally, the team&nbsp;had also published several critical essays on Livingstone’s life and times and had discovered almost 30 previously uncatalogued original manuscript items – some of them found by going through the telephone directory looking for descendants of people to whom Livingstone had sent letters whose current whereabouts were unknown. Thanks to these elements, the site had become a significant public education resource and, indeed, the project team regularly fielded queries from the public.</p>

<p>In addition, the pilot and the three-year project enabled the team to hone the principal scholarly objectives of <em>Livingstone Online</em>: “Our key goal is to make David Livingstone documents available to a worldwide audience and to use them to study medicine and science in nineteenth century Africa. Research [involves] contacting and usually visiting institutions holding David Livingstone letters. These [are] verified as authentic, scanned, transcribed and published (as both originals and transcriptions) in diplomatic form (that is with all variant reading included). They [are] edited with high quality scholarly mark up (footnotes) of the sort found in definitive editions of letters published in book form” (<em>Livingstone Online</em>, Modified Version of “Stage Two Grant Application” to the Wellcome Trust).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, 2010 witnessed the beginning of the controversial closing of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine and with it the end of hopes for a second Wellcome Trust grant. The complications in funding and personnel, therefore, threatened to end the work of <em>Livingstone Online</em>.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">The Exmouth Arms, London, 2014. Chris Lawrence and Adrian S.

<p>However, since inception, <em>Livingstone Online</em> had placed special emphasis on its collaborative relationships. These relationships extended from institutions with major and minor Livingstone holdings to individual scholars, whom director [qtip: Chris Lawrence|Chris Lawrence (Professor Emeritus, University College London). Former director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>; now director emeritus of the project.] encouraged to contribute to <em>Livingstone Online</em> and otherwise assisted by means of the project. One such scholar, [qtip: Adrian S. Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] (then at Birkbeck, University of London), had joined the team in 2009. Wisnicki found the archive in his search of letters from the last phase of Livingstone’s career and, in doing so, also found an intellectual community in Lawrence and the other team members.</p>

<p>Once on board, Wisnicki began to discuss with Lawrence a project to publish Livingstone’s final field diaries (1866-1873). Full, unabridged publication of these diaries had eluded scholars for decades. Wisnicki hoped to begin this project by focusing on a particularly damaged diary, Livingstone’s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>. Research on this diary, in collaboration with [qtip: Debbie Harrison|Debbie Harrison (Senior Visiting Fellow, The Pensions Institute, Cass Business School). Former scholar for the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project; now advisory board member for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] (Wisnicki’s colleague at Birkbeck), an American team of spectral imaging scientists, and the UCLA Digital Library eventually resulted in the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em> (2010-present), a major <em>Livingstone Online</em>-affiliated initiative funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (USA) and the British Academy.</p>

<p>The <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em> cemented [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.]’s relationship with <em>Livingstone Online</em> and resulted in an invitation from [qtip: Lawrence|Chris Lawrence (Professor Emeritus, University College London). Former director of Livingstone Online; now director emeritus of the project.] in 2010 to co-direct the main <em>Livingstone Online</em> site, which had now become publicly dormant. Between 2010 and 2013, then, Lawrence and Wisnicki explored a variety of options for continuing the work of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, including the possibility of relocating the site to Birkbeck. Both individuals recognized the significance of the work that the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team had already accomplished and the need to sustain this work in the long-term manner.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the transcription of Livingstone’s letters continued, led by current head research assistant [qtip: Heather F. Ball|Heather F. Ball (Project Cataloger, The Morgan Library &amp; Museum). Coordinating project scholar for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], whom Wisnicki had recruited to <em>Livingstone Online</em>, and carried out by a number of Wisnicki’s students (notably [qtip: A.J. Schmitz|A.J. Schmitz (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.]) at his new institution, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), as well as scholars elsewhere, including [qtip: Kate Simpson|Kate Simpson (Graduate Student, Edinburgh Napier University). Project scholar and UK outreach coordinator for Livingstone Online.] (Edinburgh Napier) and [qtip: Jared McDonald|Jared McDonald (Lecturer, University of the Free State). Associate project scholar and lead contact for South African research for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] (then SOAS). Moreover, at IUP, Wisnicki in collaboration with student programmers [qtip: Adam Colton|Adam Colton (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Web developer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] and [qtip: Annie Lin|Annie Lin (Undergraduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Web developer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] began to convert the site to the Drupal content management system, with an eye to migrating <em>Livingstone Online</em> as a whole to the UCLA Digital Library.</p>

<p>During the years 2010-13, consequently, the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team remained quite active, despite the project’s public silence and the lack of significant funding for the site itself. The team itself took on an ever-expanding international character that reflected the continuing international interest in Livingstone’s manuscript legacy. Moreover, the team’s work began to lay the groundwork for the long-term sustainability of the site and ensured that the stage remained set for a significant grant to support the next phase of the project’s development.</p>

<p>In July 1869, David Livingstone left the village of Ujiji on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika and set out west to explore what he incorrectly believed to be the western line of drainage of the Nile River. To make the journey, Livingstone traveled with Arab traders and their followers. His course took him into the eastern part of the present day Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the region of Manyema (now Maniema).</p>

<p>The party reached Bambarre, a small Congolese village and base of Arab trading activity, on 21 September 1869. From here, Livingstone expected to carry on westward to the Lualaba and Lomami Rivers, which he hoped would prove to be two of the main branches of the Nile (Livingstone 1870h:XVIII, 1870i:XLI). Instead, despite two sustained attempts to leave the village over the next year, circumstances compelled Livingstone to stay in Bambarre until 16 February 1871.</p>

Livingstone has modified and annotated the printed map based on data from informants. The relative lack of detail in the "Manyemaland," which lies just west of Lake Tanganyika, suggests that Livingstone added the annotations before actually visiting the region.</span></p>

<p>The delay proved to be one of the longest and most frustrating of his career or, as he puts it in his 1870 Field Diary, “the sorest delay I ever had” (1870j:LXIX). The nadir came when Livingstone developed flesh-eating ulcers on his feet and was forced to remain in his hut in Bambarre for 80 days, the last 20 of which he suffered from acute fever, nausea, and vomiting (1870e:X).</p>

<p>The delay wholly upended Livingstone’s ambitions as a Victorian explorer who had to keep moving in the interests of gathering geographical information. Instead, Livingstone’s world narrowed to the village of Bambarre and to its inhabitants. These included local Africans, Arab traders from East Africa, the Arabs’ African followers, Livingstone’s few attendants, and the Nassickers, a set of nine attendants from a government-run school for freed slaves in Nashik, India.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the delay led Livingstone to record his observations in the 1870 Field Diary at a level of detail and depth unseen since his famous first sojourn in southern Africa (1841-56). Previous scholarship has given little if any attention to this point and has on the whole focused instead on Livingstone’s immobility, the lack of external events in his life during the period, and his apparent mental deterioration.</p>

<p>Reginald Coupland, for instance, notes that “week after week, Livingstone sat idle at Bambarré […] What could he do? […] There was little to record in the journal. He could only read,” etc. Livingstone, Coupland adds, was “depressed,” plagued by “interminable delay,” and subject to “utter loneliness, and longing for home” (1945:83, 90). Tim Jeal enumerates the many impediments Livingstone faced at this time and underscores how Livingstone’s decision to confront these “demonstrates the almost superhuman determination of the greatest explorers never to surrender” (2011:253).</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Jeal also devotes a whole chapter of his biography to Livingstone’s “Fantasy in Manyuema” (1973:322ff.) and details Livingstone’s theories of the Central African watershed. Oliver Ransford takes this approach further by focusing on Livingstone’s “cyclothymic personality” and by discussing how in the final seven months in Bambarre (22 July 1870-16 Feb. 1871), Livingstone “escaped from the reality of loneliness and discouragement into the realms of imagination and visionary transcendentalism” (1978:264, 262).</p>

<p>A long critical tradition focuses on Livingstone’s state of mind and his activities during the period (for other examples of this approach see, e.g., Campbell 1929, Seaver 1957, Northcott 1973, Listowel 1974, Buxton 2001, Tomkins 2013, and Bayly 2014). The emphasis has prevented both critics and biographers from conceptualizing Livingstone’s immediate context – nineteenth-century Central Africa – as a complex place teeming with cultures, individuals, and forces that far exceeded Livingstone’s activities and that certainly did not center on him.</p>

<p>The issue, particularly in terms of locally-based Central African actors, extends to important historical scholarship (e.g., Bennett 1986:113-14). Even some landmark studies on the role of African populations in exploration focus only on the porters, interpreters, and guides that assisted travelers like Livingstone (e.g., Simpson 1976) or on the most famous “intermediaries” that specifically worked with Livingstone: Chuma, Wekotani, Susi, and Wainwright (Helly 1987; Kennedy 2013:170ff., also 159-94; cf. Bridges 1987:191; also see Pettitt 2007).</p>

<p>In these ways, critical approaches on the whole tend to follow Livingstone’s own lead. In rewriting and revising the 1870 Field Diary to create the corresponding segment of the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), Livingstone compressed the bulk of the diary – and all the rich local cultural detail contained therein – to a few longer passages spanning just over three pages in the journal. Concurrently, he expanded the diary’s last segment to focus on his travels between Bambarre (dep. 15 Feb. 1871) and Nyangwe (arr. 23 Mar. 1871). Such narrative inversion gives a good indication of what Livingstone thought was worth keeping and what he believed could be discarded – values in keeping with the mobility required of a Victorian explorer.</p>

<p>Such editorial practices continued when Livingstone’s friend and editor Horace Waller created the posthumously-published <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874). Waller combined the 1870 Field Diary and Unyanyembe Journal to create a hybrid record, one that would be most complete as it joined the longest parts of each text. From there, Waller and others took the original texts through a massive process of revision (Helly 1987).</p>

<p>In discussing this period of Livingstone’s life and, as relevant, the broader Central African history it encompasses, literary critics, biographers, historians, and others have for the most part worked with the <em>Last Journals</em> as their primary text, with the occasional reference to published versions of letters or other archival sources (e.g., Coupland 1945, Seaver 1957, Jeal 1973, Ross 2002, Bayly 2014). Unlike the 1871 Field Diary, the 1870 Field Diary can in large part be read with the naked eye, but it has received little if any attention.</p>

<p>In neglecting this source and others like it, such scholarship runs counter to a trend in travel writing scholarship that has been gaining in momentum since the 1970s and 80s, following on the pioneering work of historian Roy C. Bridges (1973, 1977, 1987). Bridges advocates for returning to the original field notes and similar sources of travelers like Livingstone. Bridges argues that such unabridged sources need to be read alongside revised and/or published materials in order to develop the most comprehensive understanding of encounters in the field.</p>

Livingstone never visited the majority of areas depicted in this map</span> – <span style="font-size:12px;">one of his most detailed of this part of south central Africa</span> – <span style="font-size:12px;">but rather drew on conversations with Arab and African travelers.</span></p>

<p>The approach has gained traction not only in terms of more traditional “analogue” research, such as Dane Kennedy’s recent work (e.g., 2013) or the lavishly illustrated volume on explorers’ sketchbooks (Lewis-Jones and Herbert 2016), but also in the digital humanities via such projects as <a href="https://www.oliveschreiner.org/" target="_blank">Olive Schreiner Letters Online</a>, <em>Livingstone Online</em>, and, of course, the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a>. Each of these digital projects, in fact, focuses on providing access to a range of unrevised and revised archival document types produced by Victorian visitors to Africa.</p>

<p>In some of his foundational pieces, Bridges outlines the revisionary stages through which such materials passed and discusses the complexities in differentiating among those stages (see, especially, 1977:3-4). He also highlights the heterogeneous nature of the contents of the earliest stage manuscripts and suggests that these contain the most direct information from informants, “what the explorer <em>heard</em>” (1987:181, italics in original). Of such original records, Bridges indicates, “Livingstone’s notebooks are the most important example” (1987:181).</p>

<p>Bridges\' emphasis on the priority of original records has sparked a debate in travel writing studies. Some critics, such as Tim Youngs (1994:6-7), have suggested that all travel records, whatever their stage of production, work mainly to reinscribe British imperial ideologies. Yet Bridges (1998:69 and passim) has countered by arguing “that it is possible to get behind the form of the discourse to some sort of representation of objective realities about Africa and Africans,” if one acknowledges the limitations of working with one-sided, primarily British historical records and, to compensate, takes a cross-cultural, interdisciplinary approach. (For a concise summary of the opposing arguments, see Wisnicki 2010:2.)</p>

<p>The current edition and the present essay extend the critical trend initiated by Bridges by returning to the original, unabridged text of the 1870 Field Diary, while remaining mindful of the challenges and limitations inherent in working with such a source text. In doing so, we demonstrate the value of this text (and others like it) in complicating and diversifying critical understanding of nineteenth-century intercultural encounters in the field and the historical realities of non-western populations cited in such texts.</p>

<p>In the 1870 Field Diary, we find that Livingstone’s <em>personal</em> story of travel – the type of content that he and subsequent scholars have most valued – stands alongside many, many other (often neglected) stories and historical materials related to nineteenth-century life in Central Africa.</p>

<p>This latter content makes the 1870 Field Diary a unique historical document. To create this document, Livingstone invented a medial narrative style that doesn’t quite map onto Bridges’ three stages of production (Bridges 1987:180-90; for more on this, see “Livingstone’s Composition History”). The style, as we note <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-composition-practices">elsewhere</a>, oscillates between a field diary and a journal – at least as Livingstone normally crafted such documents – and so enables Livingstone to capture the immediacy of his experiences with a reflective depth not seen in other diaries of the period.</p>

Rather, the 1870 Field Diary captures local and regional information by layering Livingstone’s reflections on Biblical, historical and contemporary European events onto narratives of local Central African events and recorded stories. Livingstone cycles through topics such as ancient geographical knowledge, contemporary debates in Britain on the production of science, disputes among African villagers, words collected from African vocabularies, botanical or zoological observations, and much more.</p>

<p>With such an approach, the diary ultimately documents the many contexts for the encroachment of Arab traders into the Congo at this historical moment. It outlines step-by-step the impact of such encroachment on local populations and their social relations. It details complex regional dynamics and the circulation of geographical, medical, agricultural, and other such information among an array of African and Arab individuals.</p>

This image presents the illustrator\'s impression of an event that Livingstone records in his diaries; it correlates with information in Livingstone\'s writings in that it presents everyone – Arabs, Africans, and Livingstone himself – as armed with guns.</span></p>

<p>Finally, the diary presents local and regional African populations not just as <em>passive</em> victims of violence, but as evolving individuals that shift from gullibility, to suspicion, and, finally, to complex strategies of resistance in their interactions with the Arab traders. The diary thus makes a breakthrough – overlooked till now – in the representation of such African populations by travelers and explorers like Livingstone.</p>

<p>This critical oversight has occurred, in part, because of sustained focus on Livingstone himself, a trend that stretches back to Henry M. Stanley’s writings (1872, etc.) and earlier. As some have observed, Livingstone became the subject of a “biographical industry” that developed from the late nineteenth-century to the mid twentieth-century (MacKenzie 1996:203; cf. Livingstone 2015). Such focus has prevented critics from giving adequate attention to the fact that late nineteenth-century travel in East and Central Africa placed explorers like Livingstone squarely in the middle of Zanzibar’s evolving African empire – a position we see uniquely captured in the 1870 diary, thanks to the unusually long time Livingstone spends in one place.</p>

<p>This empire, which reached its height during the tenure of Sultan Barghash bin Said (r.1870-1888), exerted direct or indirect influence over a vast portion of the continent and “was aggressively expansionist in its ambitions” (Kennedy 2013:120-21). The workings of the empire compelled European visitors to subsume their ambitions with the broader ambitions of the Zanzibari empire and, often, to “bend to the will” of that empire’s objectives (Kennedy 2013:100, 126).</p>

<p>In the late nineteenth-century, one of the empire’s principal expansionist tendencies focused on finding ivory to satisfy global demand – particularly in the Congo – which, Livingstone noted, was “like gold digging” (1870b:[32], cf. [24]-[33]). The ivory derived both from elephants killed for the purpose and those that had died by natural causes (see Bridges 1988:199, 207-13).</p>

<p>Much of the ivory passed through London to the rest of Europe, but there was also significant demand in the Middle East and in Asia. This ivory served the needs of “an extraordinary range of industrial products and decorative arts” including “billiard balls, knife handles and piano keys” as well as “all manner of lesser uses” (Hyam 2002:217, cf. Livingstone 1874:89-92).</p>

<p>In the Congo, world ivory demand translated into the arrival of Arab traders in the mid- to late-1860s (including the most famous of such traders Tippu Tip), the widescale introduction of firearms, and the advent of slavery, particularly to supply harems for the Arabs and porters for transporting the ivory (Northrup 1988:27-28, cf. Reid 2012, Macola 2016).</p>

<p>Expansion into the Congo proceeded by the creation of depots and bases, which the Arab traders and their followers then used to launch forays farther afield. The trading parties, often financed by capital from Indian merchants on the East African coast, brought together diverse individuals, including “Omani Arabs, coastal Swahili, inland Africans, and others” (Northrup 1988:23). Despite European characterization, labor in these trading parties took highly differentiated forms.</p>

<p>In East Africa, the Nyamwezi ethnic group pioneered a sophisticated culture of “wage labor shaped by indigenous precapitalist labor norms, but closely linked to merchant capital and the global economy” (Rockell 2006:6). The use of slaves as porters in the Congo – where other ethnic groups, such as the Bira (in the northeast) and Bisa (in the southeast), had previously dominated trade – constituted a break with East African caravan norms (Livingstone 1870b:[69], Wilson 1972, Rockell 2006:17).</p>

<p>The rush for ivory also compelled the traders “to build up their own infrastructure” and, as Tippu Tip eventually did, to organize a state, one nominally independent, but still loosely aligned with Zanzibar (Sheriff 1987:190, Vansina 1968:238, Renault 1989:161-63). Ujiji, on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, served an important gateway to the emerging Central African infrastructure and, indeed, the village was Livingstone’s departure point in 1869 (Bennett 1974:226-28).</p>

The similitude between this illustration and any real street in nineteenth-century Zanzibar is unknown, but the illustration helps foreground the diversity of the island\'s population. This diversity, and particularly its underlying power dynamics, played a key role in structuring Zanzibar\'s trading empire.</span></p>

<p>Livingstone thus developed the 1870 Field Diary in the context of Zanzibari imperial expansion, so forces and events engineered by the expansion shaped his immediate experiences and the content of his writing. Attention to this dynamic allows for a richer critical account of Livingstone’s discursive circumstances and the regional information captured by the diary. Indeed, although critics have long dismissed this period in Livingstone\'s life as one of stasis or as providing insights only into Livingstone\'s state of mind, Livingstone\'s diary, in fact, captures the intricacies – from the ground up – of the evolving intercultural dynamic in Central Africa during this time.</p>

<p>Likewise, cultural developments in the immediate area of the Congo from which Livingstone wrote – Manyema – also influenced the composition and content of the diary. Livingstone arrived in the area at a moment of upheaval, especially in terms of evolving social relations between Arab traders and local Central African populations. Livingstone’s extended stay in Bambarre gave him – the only European in a mix of Arab and African populations – a unique vantage point on these changing social relations.</p>

<p>West of Lake Tanganyika, where trade had previously taken a regional form, Arab expansion followed two principal directions. Initially, efforts focused on the regions of Kazembe and Katanga in the south and south east, respectively. Once the ivory in those regions dwindled, Arab traders moved north, into Manyema where Livingstone composed both the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries (Sheriff 1987:187-90). Arab settlement in Manyema focused on a few locations, among them Nyangwe, Kasongo, and to a lesser degree Bambarre (Wisnicki 2013:211, Sheriff 1987:190), hence the reason Livingstone found himself in the latter village in the first place.</p>

<p>In this region, ivory abounded and so propelled Arab trader initiatives. Livingstone, for instance, complained of the “Californian gold fever at Ujiji” that prevented getting carriers and in one case described meeting “a band of Ujijian traders carrying 18000 lbs weight of ivory bought in this new field” (1870i:L, XLII). Livingstone also detailed the ongoing expansion of the trade, with references to traders pushing towards new frontiers, both west of the Lualaba River in the direction of the Lomami River and further north along the Lualaba, towards the rainforests of Legaland (e.g., 1870h:XVII-XVIII).</p>

Idyllic illustrations such as this one and the next below contrast with the volatile circumstances occasioned by the arrival of Arab traders in the region, as documented in texts like the 1870 Field Diary.</span></p>

<p>The arrival of the traders in these regions, not unexpectedly, led to tensions with the local populations and created long-term hardships for those populations. Before the traders arrived, global trade had reached southern Manyema only indirectly. Rather, local economic influences predominated: “In the three decades between 1865 and 1895, the peoples of eastern [Congo] lost their autonomy, first to Afro-Arab traders in the service of the Sultan of Zanzibar and then to the Congo Free State in the service of King Leopold II of Belgium” (Northrup 1988:13). The populations of the region evolved complex relationships with the local geography, including the development of mixed agriculture and cattle-keeping, and built vibrant trade with the hunter-gatherer populations to the north (Northrop 1988:13-18, Wisnicki 2013:218ff.).</p>

<p>Livingstone characterized the diversity of these local populations, which did not correlate with Victorian expectations of African social organization or reigning European ideas of the nation, in different terms. He grouped the many regional populations under the single term “Manyema,” yet simultaneously faulted their lack of cohesion, especially at the political level: “The great want of the Manyema is national life. Of this they have none. Each headman is independent of every other” (1870g:{29}, cf. 1870i:XXIII).</p>

<p>Although a rich and evolving cultural and economic fabric bound together the many communities in this part of Central Africa (Vansina 1990), the Manyema region didn’t have a unifying military presence or a single, prominent leader like the Sultan of Zanzibar or the Kabaka of Buganda. As a result, Livingstone faulted the region for the lack of a visible centralized state and strong principal ruler.</p>

<p>Livingstone also argued that this political and social configuration brought technological development in the region to a “permanent halt,” led to war serving as the only solution for regional conflicts, and made relations among local populations particularly susceptible to interference by the Arab traders (1870h:XVII, XIX; 1870i:XXIII).</p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary characterizes the conflict between Arab traders and African populations in Manyema by progressively zeroing in on two specific groups: traders from Ujiji and residents of the village of Bambarre, today known primarily as the Bangubangu ethnic group (Maes and Boone 1935, Raucq 1952:35-36, Boone 1961, Maho 2009:34; cf. Vansina 1968:Map D and Butcher 2008:143-49).</p>

<p>Authorities suggest that the collective name of Bangubangu originated as an Arab or European appellation (Boone 1961:5; cf. Biebuyck 1973:19n.) and trace the genealogy of the group in two ways. Some foreground links to the Lega to the north (Biebuyck 1973:xix, 10, 18), while others count the Bangubangu among the people of Congo’s Kasai-Katanga region to the south, noting that ties between the Bangubangu and the neighboring Luba originated in the early nineteenth century (Raucq 1952: 42, 44; Vansina 1966:161-73, especially 162; cf. Wisnicki 2013:218-19).</p>

<p>These complex origins reflect a long-term reality. In the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone makes a point to distinguish the inhabitants of Bambarre – the “Bambarre people” (1870i:XXXVI, XXXVII, 1870k:LXXIII) – from the Lega (1870i:XXXVII) and to trace the origin of the former to the Luba on the south and southwest. Yet Livingstone also indicates that Bambarre\'s residents do have some links with the Lega (Livingstone 1870h:XVII; cf. Cameron 1877a,2:66-69, who places more emphasis on the links between the Luba and the inhabitants of Bambarre).</p>

<p>Livingstone’s act of naming the local population and fixing it in Bambarre or more regionally in Manyema has an important discursive implication. The act enables Livingstone to introduce a key set of protagonists into his narrative, to characterize them, and to point to “the isolation in which they live” (1870b:[1], cf. Northrup 1988:19-20). Against these protagonists, Livingstone’s diary then pits the Arab traders and their followers or, to use Livingstone’s terms, the “Ujijians” or “Ujijian traders” (1870b:[69]; 1870e:XIII; 1870i:XXXV, XLII; 1871e:CI).</p>

<p>Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary embodies a first-hand chronicle of the arrival of these traders in Manyema and their forays into new regions to the west and north. The chronicle includes Livingstone’s eye-witness testimony of damage done by the traders, as when he reports having “passed through nine villages destroyed by the worthies who did not wish me to see more of their work” (1870b:[26]). The diary also records narratives of violence collected from the traders themselves (1870i:XXIX-XXXI, 1870k:LXXIV, 1870d:{23}-{24}).</p>

<p>In some cases, the violence bears an eerie ring of familiarity, particularly in the context of the marketplace massacre Livingstone himself would witness in July 1871 in Nyangwe. Passages from the 1870 Field Diary, such as the following, read almost as if they came from the later 1871 narrative of the events at Nyangwe: “these three then fired into a mass of men who collected one killed two another three &amp; so on” (1870k:LXXIV; cf. 1871f:CXLVI ff.).</p>

<p>Given Livingstone’s close relations with some Arabs, their tendency towards violence proves difficult to reconcile. At times, Livingstone attempts to separate the main Arab traders from their followers and blames conflicts on the latter: “The nine villages and a [sic] 100 men killed by Katomba’s slaves at Nasangwa were all about a string of beads fastened to a powder horn which a [M]anyema man tried in vain to steal” (1870e:X).</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">Dr. Livingstone, I Presume? Illustration from Stanley\'s <em>How I Found Livingstone</em> (1872,2:opposite 412). <em>Courtesy of Edinburgh University Library</em>. The focus on Livingstone and Stanley draws attention away from the fact that their meeting in Ujiji with a diverse array of individuals in attendance was driven less by individual preference or initiative and much more by broader economic forces and pressures due to the expansion of Zanzibar\'s trading empire into Central Africa via Ujiji.</span></p>

<p>Elsewhere, he lumps the different groups together, differentiating only by degree: “The traders from Ujiji are simply marauders, and their people worse than themselves thirst for blood more than for ivory – Each longs to be able to tell a tale of blood, and Manyema are an easy prey” (1871e:XCVII).</p>

<p>While reflecting on the regional situation, Livingstone introduces an additional conflict, now at the ideological level, between Christianity and Islam. He finds that he simply cannot make sense of the contrast between his own commitment as a missionary – however nominal at this stage in his career – and the failure of the Arabs and their followers to pursue similar ambitions for spreading Islam (1870k:LXXIV, 1871e:C-CI).</p>

In a passage that implicitly contrasts his conduct as missionary with that of Swahili traders (whom he conflates with Arab traders), Livingstone writes: "These Suaheli are the most cruel and bloodthirsty missionaries in existence and withal so impure in talk &amp; acts - spreading syphilis Buboes &amp; chancres - The Lord sees it."</span></p>

<p>These circumstances inspire some of the most vituperative language in the 1870 Field Diary. In reviewing the conduct of the Arab traders, Livingstone in turn assails the falsehood of those with whom he is personally acquainted, some of the foundational ideas of Islam and its holiest city, and, finally, the founder of the religion himself (1871e:LXXIX, LXXXI-LXXXIII, XCVIII).</p>

<p>One example of Livingstone’s language suffices to convey the whole: “[The cholera at Zanzibar] we get from Mecca filth – nothing was done to prevent the place being made a perfect cesspool of animals guts &amp; ordure of men” (1871e:LXXIX; cf. 1874,2:96-98, where Waller has preserved only some of the relevant passages). Such passages – however they might read today – were not unusual in the Victorian era and reflected rising, late nineteenth-century concerns about the spread of Islam and an inevitable struggle between Christians and Muslims (Livingstone 2014:131-32; cf. Kennedy 2013:202).</p>

<p>The presence of such passages alongside others where Livingstone praises his Arab friends (e.g., 1870i:XLII, 1871e:LXXXIX-XCIV) also highlights the 1870 Field Diary’s role in capturing the experience of the field in nineteenth-century Central Africa. The diary – effectively an unrevised process narrative – details Livingstone’s often unsuccessful attempts to resolve the incongruities between his personal experiences and guiding cultural and religious beliefs.</p>

<p>Such complexities lead Livingstone to develop a kind of narrative style new to the diaries from his last expedition to Africa. The style, particularly its rapid transitions between themes and events, enables Livingstone to alternate theories of the Nile River system, with:</p>

<ul style="padding-left:2.5em;">
	<li>first-hand observations on local African cultural practices and social dynamics,</li>
	<li>reflections on his own travels and delays,</li>
	<li>complaints about his attendants,</li>
	<li>narratives of local events gathered from his informants,</li>
	<li>notes on the evolving state of his own health,</li>
	<li>discussion of personal grudges against individuals back home and in East Africa,</li>
	<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together the entries take on a stream-of-consciousness form where representation of local priorities and concerns become layered upon Livingstone’s own experiences and observations as well as reflections on historical events and actors.</p>

This undated map shows, in its lower half, Manyema and, in its upper half, Legaland. The village of Bambarre in the lower center of the map appears under the name of its chief Moenekuss. More importantly, the map demonstrates the scale of information that Livingstone managed to collect about the waterways of Legaland (which he never visited) and how this information could take the form of both cartographical detail (what Livingstone has mapped) and oral narrative (what Livingstone has captured in prose).</span></p>

<p>The overall narrative of the diary, including the scale of the information that Livingstone records, grows out of his unique situation and circumstances in 1870. Livingstone bashes contemporary “theoretical discoverers,” who pursued geographical research by integrating the observations of others rather than engaging in first-hand exploration (1870c:II). Yet Livingstone fails to acknowledge that he himself operates like a “theoretical” explorer, albeit one based in Central Africa. He dreams of traveling like the Arab traders, but complex factors have halted his progress (e.g., 1870i:LIV-LV). To compensate, he gathers knowledge through interviews of the individuals that surround him.</p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary shows Livingstone to be very well informed about local and regional events despite his immobility. Each group of traders that arrives in Bambarre, from whatever direction, further enlarges Livingstone’s store of knowledge. The scale of this knowledge best emerges through an enumeration of the locations from which Livingstone shares news in the 1870 Field Diary. These locations include:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) Nearby villages such as Mamohela and Kasongo (1870b:[24]-[33], 1870i:XXIX);<br />
2) Areas north, both along the Lualaba River to Nyangwe and further afield (1870b:[24]-[33], [41]-[45]; 1870e:X; 1870h:XIX; 1870i:XXI, LIV-LV; also see the map on 1871a: [LXXVI v.2]);<br />
3) Legaland and the regions beyond as far as Lake Albert (1870b:[33]-[40]; 1870h:XVII; 1870i:XXIX-XXXI, LV [v.1]; also see the map on 1870f:[XIV v.2]);<br />
4) Lubaland and Lunda to the south and, to the southwest, Katanga (1870c:[I], 1870f: XIV [v.1], 1870i:XXI);<br />
5) Ujiji, the principal East African trading routes, the east coast of Africa, and Zanzibar (1870d:{21}-{22}; 1870e:XI; 1871b:LXXIX, LXXXI);<br />
6) The areas north and northeast of Unyanyembe all the way to Buganda and Masaailand (1870f:[XIV v.2]; 1871b:LXXIX, LXXXI);<br />
7) Mecca and the Arabian Peninsula (1870i:XL, 1871b:LXXXIII); and<br />
8) Madagascar (1870i:XL).</p>

<p>Despite his apparent isolation, Livingstone collects information about vast swaths of Central Africa, East Africa, and even more distant regions.</p>

Although such images appear to supplement Livingstone\'s written records of slave trading atrocities, the images also elide the fact that to gain this perspective Livingstone not only traveled with and relied on slave traders, but in many instances also befriended them.</span></p>

<p>Yet acquiring this knowledge – which derives from Arab and African informants – comes with a cost. To reach Central Africa and to survive once there, Livingstone is compelled to form his close relationships with some Arab traders, as noted. This is not lost on the local African populations. In the eyes of these populations, Livingstone’s continuing associations with the Arab traders and his own followers undercut and even trump his activities on behalf of local Africans.</p>

<p>Sometimes the local populations respond favorably to Livingstone and recognize his intentions, but at other times they refuse to make distinctions and are “outspoken in asserting [the] identity [of Livingstone and his attendants] with the cruel strangers” (Livingstone 1870e:XIII, 1870i:XLIII, cf. 1866-72:[652], Stanley 1878,2:79-80).</p>

In this passage, Livingstone discusses the kindness of some Arab traders and notes his attempts to reciprocate that kindness, including presenting one such trader (Katomba) with a "double barrelled gun."</span></p>

<p>Such moments reflect deeper affinities. Early on, Livingstone cites the role of his Nassicker attendants in taking slaves and in killing local inhabitants in imitation of the Arab traders (1870b:[55]-[62], 1870i:LIII). Later he documents how the freed Banian slaves sent to Livingstone by John Kirk, the British political agent at Zanzibar, extend the Nassicker model of violence against locals (1871b:LXXXIV, 1871e:XCI-XCIV, CI). In each case, Livingstone admits his complicity in bringing such violence to Central Africa, but either justifies the decision (1870i:LII-LIV) or attempts to assert his personal innocence: “I am clear of blood guiltiness” (1871e:CI).</p>

<p>Livingstone’s diary thus offers a compelling record of the experience in the Central African field. The narrative’s oscillating, heterogenous style captures the conflicting pressures Livingstone faces as a Christian explorer and geographer committed to preventing violence against local populations in Manyema but simultaneously compelled to operate within the confines of Zanzibar’s trading empire, relying on a variety of individuals with conflicting loyalties, including Arabs, freed Banian slaves, and Nassicker attendants.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s decision to visit Maneyma – the first European to do so and among the first to visit this whole part of Central Africa – and his extended sojourn in Bambarre also lead to a unique transformation in his composition practices as a diarist. He begins to capture his observations about the local cultures at a level of detail that distinguishes the 1870 Field Diary from the majority of the 20-odd other field diaries and notebooks that Livingstone kept on this final expedition to Africa.</p>

<p>The presence of such information would have had a complex resonance with Livingstone’s contemporaries and, in fact, may have reflected an opposition in professional standards. The content of the information would have satisfied professional expectations for ethnographic information gathered in the field, but Livingstone’s methods, particularly his heavy reliance on informants, would have undermined the credibility of his geographical pronouncements (Kennedy 2013:132, 199, cf. 158). Victorian geographers considerd any data not collected through first-hand observation as inferior and even dubious, as most famously in the case of John H. Speke, who twice (1858, 1862) visited Lake Victoria – the lake now accepted as the real source of the Nile – but failed to convince contemporaries of his claims because of recourse to second-hand information (Wisnicki 2008).</p>

Speke\'s dubious geographical practices (by Victorian standards) raised serious questions about his results among contemporaries such as Livingstone, who has here altered Speke\'s cartographical pronouncements by breaking up Lake Victoria into a series of lakes, while adding a dotted red line that could ultimately allow him, Livingstone, to claim a more southerly source for the Nile.</span></p>

<p>In collecting his information, Livingstone usually follows one of two trajectories. Most predictably, the diary includes a variety of ad hoc observations as when Livingstone describes funeral rites, generalizes about the appearance of the populations, outlines agricultural practices, and discusses religious beliefs in Manyema (1870b:[1]-[6], [44]-[45]; 1870e:XII; 1870i:XXVI). Thanks to his medical background, he also includes notes on the presence of ailments, the use of local medicines, and the role of the traders in spreading STIs (e.g., 1870d:{19}-{21}, 1870e:X, 1870i:LXIII-LV).</p>

<p>At the same time, Livingstone makes a sustained effort to explore and document social conduct in Bambarre and Manyema. The diary opens with a series of anecdotes about the behavior of regional chiefs, includes a story about the death of the oldest son of Moenekuss (the headman of Bambarre), and describes the habits of another regional headman, Merere, and his father (1870b:[7]-[12], 1870g:{29}-{30}, 1870i:XXVIII-XXIX).</p>

<p>Livingstone also devotes a fair amount of attention to the details of Manyema villages, explores regional trading dynamics (a topic to which he will return at length in the 1871 Field Diary), and touches on local systems of justice (1870b:[43]-[45], [63]-[70]; 1870j:LXVII-LXVIII). At one point Livingstone even develops an annotated genealogy of the house of Charura, a deceased African headman, to which genealogy he, Livingstone, later returns to provide additional detail (1870k:LXXII, 1871b:LXXXII).</p>

<p>Such information, even if it only appears in flashes, recenters the 1870 Field Diary on local African populations and acknowledges their independent motivations, while pushing the story of Livingstone’s own efforts as an explorer, abolitionist, and missionary to the narrative margins. The 1870 Field Diary thus begins to portray Bambarre and the surrounding area as a vibrant regional location, one filled with diverse and clearly differentiated individuals that are linked by complex social dynamics and driven by complex, self-generated objectives that Livingstone may not fully understand but that he gradually begins to recognize and acknowledge.</p>

<p>Close critical attention to this local Central African universe also shows similar, independent forces that undermine any narrative of victimization that Livingstone might try to impose on the local African populations. The forces take the form of active, inventive, and sustained resistance by the local populations to the Arab traders, their followers, and Livingstone himself.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;display:inline-block;text-align:left;max-width:90%">A processed spectral image of a page of the 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870h:XVII pseudo_v1), detail. <em>Copyright David Livingstone Centre. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. This passage, which includes a map of rivers linked to Lake Tanganyika and documents a reported conversation between Arab traders and representatives of the Lega ethnic group, succinctly encapsulates the extreme hostility of Central African populations to the traders: "[...] Balegga very unfriendly – collected in thousands – we came to buy ivory - said Hassani &amp; if there is none we go away | \'Nay\' shouted they, \'you came to die here\' then shot with arrows - when shot was returned they fled &amp; would not come to receive the captives."</span></p>

<p>It is no secret that the local populations in Manyema resent the arrival of the Arabs, as in the case of the Bira ethnic group who, notes Livingstone, “are now enraged at seeing Ujijians pass into their ivory field” (1870b:[69]). This anger translates into multiple skirmishes with the Arab traders.</p>

<p>One example gives a sense of the whole: “Moenemokia killed 2 Arab agents &amp; took their guns […] Elsewhere they made regular preparation to have a fight with Dugumbe\'s people just to see who was strongest. They with their spears &amp; wooden shields or the Arabs with what in derision they called tobacco pipes (guns)[.] They killed eight or nine Arabs” (1870b:[59], [61]-[62]; cf. 1870i:XXXVIII). The local populations not only resist the Arab traders, but kill them and their followers, and, notably, capture their firearms. In other words, the populations act independently of the traders – i.e., don’t just get caught up in the expansionist agenda that the traders seek to impose upon them – and, at least occasionally, succeed in turning the tables on the traders.</p>

<p>Later history would show such overt tactics to be ineffective in the face of a growing and ever more aggressive and organized Arab slave trade. But Livingstone’s diary captures the emergence and effects of the resistance strategies at a moment, in 1870, when the future remains undecided. On one hand, the courage of the local populations draws respect from the traders: “The Mamohela horde is becoming terrified [–] Every party going to trade has lost three or four men and the last foray lost ten and saw that the Manyema can fight” (1870i:XXXIV, cf. XXXI). On the other, Livingstone’s diary also tracks the increasing skill of the local populations in engaging in more subtle forms of warfare, as in the case of the Merere, a local headman and descendant of Charura.</p>

<p>In a brief narrative included near the end of the 1870 Field Diary, Merere first turns against the Arabs, killing one and robbing others “of all they had,” then repents of his behavior and indicates that he will “repay all loses” (1871b:LXXX). Livingstone seems unsure of how to characterize this behavior: “He looks as if insane &amp; probably is so” (1871b:LXXX). Merere emerges as a cipher, an individual whose motivations and conduct exceed Livingstone’s abilities to assess them definitively.</p>

The detached page, the earliest surviving page of the gathering, refers to the apparent practice of cannibalism in Bambarre.</span></p>

<p>In such ways, the African populations residing in or near Bambarre begin to cultivate indeterminate, unpredictable behavior as a method of resistance alongside more open physical violence. The 1870 Field Diary oscillates between offering Livingstone’s rationalizations for these actions and representing these populations (and their tactics) on their own terms, even if that forecloses Livingstone’s attempts to rationalize events.</p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary’s running commentary on the practice of cannibalism exemplifies this devleopment. Other explorers, such as Henry M. Stanley, document instances of local African populations pretending to be cannibals in other to resist Arab traders (1876–1877, entries after 25 October 1876; also see Wisnicki 2013:226) and that seems to be the case in the 1870 Field Diary as well.</p>

<p>The diary begins with a discussion of cannibalism in relation to funeral practices (1870b:[1]-[6]), and, later, Livingstone offers a genealogy of the practice by linking it to the practice of eating sokos (i.e., gorillas) (1870c:IV).</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">Manyuema Hunters Killing Sokos. (From a Sketch by Dr. Livingstone.) Illustration from the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874,2:opposite 52). <em>Courtesy of the </em><a href="https://archive.org//" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>. Although Livingstone\'s original sketch has not been located, the general characteristics of his drawing style (as seen in his other writings) suggest that the illustrator has here distorted the features of the Africans to reflect Victorian stereotypes of African savagery and, possibly, to accentuate Livingstone\'s hypothesis "that eating sokos was the first stage by which [the inhabitants of Manyema] arrived at being cannibals," which appears on the page directly following this illustration (Livingstone 1874,2:53; cf. 1870b:IV).</span></p>

<p>Yet such assertions stand alongside more tentative statements. Livingstone opens his draft letter to Lord Stanley by describing Manyema as the country of “the <em>reputed</em> cannibals” and elsewhere notes that the population now engages in the practice in secret because of the manifest disgust of the traders (1870i:XLI, emphasis added; 1870k:LXXV).</p>

<p>Livingstone thus indicates that his characterizations may be based more on hearsay than the direct observation requisite for the professional practice of Victorian-era exploration. This move introduces an irreducible strand of ambiguity into the narrative of the 1870 Field Diary that Livingstone himself later foregrounds.</p>

The opening of a copy of the letter to Lord Stanley (15 Nov. 1870) that Livingstone embedded in the 1870 Field Diary. In this opening, Livingstone states the he writes from Manyema, the country of "the <em>reputed</em> cannibals." (emphasis added).</span></p>

<p>When discussing the population of Bambarre just prior to leaving – i.e., when his information should be most accurate due to his long sojourn in the village – he first states that “their cannibalism is doubtful” only to reverse himself a few pages later by indicating that the locals are “undoubtedly cannibals” (1871b:LXXXIII, LXXXVII).</p>

<p>In the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone never resolves this contradiction or, alternatively, never manages to circumscribe it in terms that are comprehensible to him. Rather, the diary’s narrative framework summons up an alternative African epistemological system – even if only tacitly – that stands alongside of the British one in which Livingstone operates. Livingstone, in turn, leaves the people of Bambarre on this note and heads for Nyangwe, where he will turn to his remaining iron gall ink and a torn-up copy of <em>The Standard</em> to compose the 1871 Field Diary.</p>

<p>The fate of these passages on cannibalism underscores the challenges posed overall in interpreting the narrative materials produced by Livingstone during this period. As Livingstone first and then, posthumously, his friend Horace Waller edited these materials, the former’s cultural observations took on a more abridged form, then became subsumed within biographical details, thereby setting up a long-standing history of critical response.</p>

<p>For instance, when Livingstone later revised the 1870 Field Diary into the more polished Unyanyembe Journal form, he collected the many references to cannibalism into a single longer passage and conflated them with general observations about violence in Manyema (1866-72:[646]-[648]). Horace Waller, conversely, in producing the text of the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874), kept most of the 1870 Field Diary’s random references to cannibalism intact. Yet Waller considerably dampened the immediate, fragmentary nature of the diary and its unresolved tensions by tampering with the text, combining the diary’s text with that of the journal, and introducing a series of extra-textual digressions (see Livingstone 1874,2:52, 55, 61, 62, 63-64, 65, 86-87, 88, 89-92, 94-95, 108).</p>

<p>In so doing, Waller chose to prioritize a narrative in which Africans are cast as reactive victims, as Livingstone before him. This editorial move cut against the representation of an intricate Central African universe and discursive framework whose differentiated actors could not only evolve as self-driven individuals, but also, as part of that evolution, develop nuanced and creative methods of resistance:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">[M]y long detention in Manyema leads me to believe that they are truly a bloody people – cold blooded murders are frightfully common and they say that but for our presence they would <sub>^</sub> <sup>be</sup> still more frequent – They have no fear of spears and shields – guns alone frighten them – they tell us frankly and quite truly that but for our firearms not one of us should ever return to his country. (1871b:LXXXIII)</p>

<p>Such passages, omitted from both the Unyanyembe Journal and <em>Last Journals</em> and silenced till now, show a rebellious local population, innovative in their tactics of instilling fear in their adversaries, skilled in combining brute force with sophisticated psychological strategies. These passages, which foreground the independence of mind of these populations, stand in stark contrast to more common, stereotypical Victorian representations of African helplessness. The passages also underscore that editions such as this one embody only an initial step in a full-scale, ever-more-necessary, historical reassessment of the manuscript record of exploration.</p>

<p>In Field Diary V, Livingstone journeys from the shores of Lake Nyassa west through mountains in modern-day Malawi. Along the way, he finds plentiful food, most of it given to them by local populations. Perhaps as a result, in this diary Livingstone records far fewer instances of mutiny or struggles for authority among his men.</p>

<p>Instead, field diary five chronicles Livingstone\'s return to the work that first brought him to Africa: medicine and Christian conversion. His medical notes document the presence of syphilis, whopping cough, small pox, leprosy, and "hemp effects" (Livingstone 1866d:[82]). The diary also manifests his interest in the spread of diseases. In response to his questions on this front, one patient reports that syphilis was "known in the country before the Arabs came into it - They give them the small pox only" (Livingstone 1866d:[36])</p>

<p>Livingstone initiates many conversations about Christianity, asking the people he encounters if they have heard of the "Revelation we possess" (Livingstone 1866d:[25]). In particular, he seems interested in the spread of Christian ideas. When he finds that the Manganja people have heard of "such a one who died," he surmises that "It is probable that they &amp; the Tanganyika and Zambesi people are one" (Livingstone 1866d:[25]).</p>

<p>Livingstone fuses his abolition work to his missionary zeal. When in Gwomba, a chief asks him to preach his "words of peace." Livingstone responds by talking of the Bible but also "the sin of selling his children" and a "Future state where all will be judged." Based on this, he advises the people "to expel enemies who came first as slave traders" (Livingstone 1866d:[68]-[69]). Similarly, he elsewhere uses the Christian rhetoric of sin to describe slaving: "the slave traders temptations are very strong" (Livingstone 1866d:[45]).</p>

<p>Cultural observations, too, seem bound up in these recurring concerns, as he makes notes on what he sees as the moral character of the local populations. For instance, he contrasts the Manganja, who mourn their dead, to the war-like Waiyau, who must be appeased with by giving up village members to them (Livingstone 1866d:[40], [68]). Manganja are "more civil" but fewer in number than "dominant" Waiuyau, who have guns to the Manganjas\' bows and arrows (Livingstone 1866d:[55]). In addition, there are notes about local crops, Africans\' dress and appearance, and animals.</p>

<p>This diary is the same kind of book as the previous field diaries. Like the first two, it includes a frontispiece note from the late 1940s-early 1950s by Rev. James McNair, who writes that there is "no very close correspondence between these notes and the Last Journ[als]" (Livingstone 1866d:[3]). The first page entry is in black ink, but the majority of the diary is in grey pencil, with occasional over-inking in black or additions in orange pencil. As with the previous diaries, Livingstone writes from both ends of the diary at once, meeting on page [90] with an entry from 22 October 1866. In this way, each small book continues to function both as a detailed record for the future and as more immediate notation of mileage, temperature, payment, and vocabulary.</p>

<p>It has been an immense privilege to work on this phase (2013-17) of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project. The members of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-team">project team</a> are grateful to the individuals below who have supported our work and to those individuals who supported the <a href="http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/1871diary/acknowledgments.htm" target="_blank">first phase of the project</a> (2010-13), as that phase laid some of the groundwork for the current phase.</p>

<p>We also wish to acknowledge the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanties</a> (USA), our collaborating institutions, and the extraordinary staff at these institutions, particularly the <a href="http://www.nts.org.uk/property/david-livingstone-centre/" target="_blank">David Livingstone Centre</a>, the <a href="http://www.nls.uk/" target="_blank">National Library of Scotland</a>, <a href="http://www.unl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>, and the <a href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland Libraries</a>. Without the generous assistance of these individuals and institutions, the project would not have gone forward.</p>

<p>Additionally, the project director Adrian S. Wisnicki would like to single out two individuals for their support. The first, <strong>Marco Abel</strong> (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), has been an immense friend to the project and his support will not be forgotten. The second, <strong>Liz Maxwell</strong>, the director\'s wife, has believed in our work beginning to end like no one else, and so to her the director\'s work on this project is dedicated.</p>

<p>The items we published derive from the physical collections of over <a href="/behind-scenes/collaborating-institutions">40 repositories around the world</a>; in many cases, these represent all Livingstone manuscripts held by those repositories. Although the digital files cannot replace the experience of interacting with the original items, the files nonetheless enable individual and comparative encounter with the items in ways difficult if not impossible in the real world.</p>

<p>Our digital collection encompass all facets of Livingstone\'s writing career and spans a diverse range of genres, including letters, essays, field diaries, research notebooks, maps, sketches, book manuscripts, marked proof engravings, biblical quotations, prescriptions, and autographs. Among our top treasures we count:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The 1,100 page manuscript of <em><a href="/islandora/search/Missionary travels?full_record=0&amp;order=Title&amp;access=download&amp;f[]=genre_ms%3A%22manuscripts+for+publication%22">Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</a></em> (1857), the book that established Livingstone’s reputation as one of the leading explorers of his day;</li>
	<li>Nearly all the surviving field diaries, journals, notebooks, and maps (over 2,000 pages) related to Livingstone’s last expedition to Africa (1866-73), among the largest such manuscript collections related to any nineteenth-century British expedition to Africa (forthcoming in 2017);</li>
	<li>Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre-0">Letter from Bambarre</a> and the <a href="http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870</a> and <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871</a> Field Diaries, the first nineteenth-century British manuscripts to be studied with <a href="/spectral-imaging/introducing-livingstone-spectral-imaging-project">spectral imaging technology</a>; and</li>
	<li>Collections of Livingstone\'s letters to key individuals in his life such as <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=addressee_ms%3A%22Livingstone%2C+Agnes+3%2C+1847-1912%22">Agnes Livingstone</a>, <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=addressee_ms%3A%22Moffat%2C+Robert+1%2C+1795-1883%22">Robert Moffat</a>, <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=addressee_ms%3A%22Murray%2C+John+III%2C+1808-1892%22">John Murray III</a>, <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=addressee_ms%3A%22Murchison%2C+Roderick+I.%2C+1792-1871%22">Roderick Murchison</a>, and <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=addressee_ms%3A%22Kirk%2C+John+2%2C+1832-1922%22">John Kirk</a>.</li>

<span style="font-size:12px;">Notes and Calculations for Field Diary XVII, 7-9 April 1873 (Livingstone 1873a:[2]). <em>Copyright David Livingstone Centre. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. This previously undoucmented fragment came to light in 2013 as the project team prepared to image the Livingstone manuscripts held by the David Livingstone Centre. The dated entries span 7 to 9 April 1873, the last month of Livingstone\'s life, and are similar to the entries for the same dates in Field Diary XVII (see Livingstone 1873:[9]-[13]). The fragment indicates that even at this late date in his life, Livingstone continued to take his manuscripts through multiple stages of revision.</span></p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> takes pride in being a public project, by which we mean a project that is publicly funded and that recognizes the importance of being publicly accountable, as noted <a href="/behind-scenes/livingstone-online-code">elsewhere</a>. In that spirit, we seek to make our research as open and transparent as possible, particularly so that others developing similar projects can study, learn from, and indeed improve upon our work.</p>

<p>This section of <em>Livingstone Online</em> makes a significant portion of our day-to-day project documents publicly available. The documents, created during the development of&nbsp;<a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2016">LEAP: The <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project</a>, have been carefully selected to be as representative (and comprehensive) as possible and encompass all aspects of our work, including team meetings, digitization, data management, transcription, website development, and&nbsp;dissemination. Together the documents track every step of our research and capture, in intimate terms, the many&nbsp;dimensions of our international collaboration.</p>

<p><em><span style="font-size:14px;">Note: Interested users will also find the project documents embedded in the <a href="/about-site/leap-2013-2016-project-history-part-i">two-part project history of LEAP</a>, where the narrative sets the creation of these documents in a broader context.</span></em></p>

<p>As detailed in the previous section, Livingstone created the 1870 Field Diary manuscript over a period of time and based on a series of complex decisions. This process, as studied through the leaves of the diary itself, provides important insights into Livingstone’s work as a traveler and writer. Below, we continue our analysis of the diary by now turning to the many ways that Livingstone (and, later, British archivists) structured his record of the field.</p>

<p>During his last journey (1866-73), Livingstone regularly copied his field diaries into a large journal, now known as the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72). Livingstone’s diaries contain the occasional reference to his practice of “copying notes into journal” (1871n:[24], see also 1866c:[77], 1866d:[19], 1871n:[45]). At times, he carried this journal with him and so had easy access to it. However, during his 1869-71 travels, the journal remained in Ujiji, as we see in one of the documents included in this edition: “Retrospect to be inserted in the Journal if I get back to where it is left in Ujiji” (1870a:[1]).</p>

<p>When Livingstone parted with Stanley on 14 March 1872, the former entrusted the now sealed journal to the latter’s care: “This Journal sent home from Unyanyembe by Henry M. Stanley” (1866-72:[7], cf. 1871n:47). The journal, in turn, ultimately became the basis of the published <em>Last Journals</em> (1874), as edited by Horace Waller.</p>

In both cases, these may be allusions to his copying over the 1870 Field Diary into the Unyanyembe Journal.

<p>As a result, the 1870 Field Diary, like Livingstone’s other final field diaries, is a relational document, i.e., a text Livingstone used and conceived of in relation to the journal. Moreover, the 1870 Field Diary makes repeated references to this relational status, as does the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>.</p>

<p>For instance, the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary ends with a note that it is “[t]o be copied into the Journal” (1870b:[70]). 1870e:X of the second gathering opens with this same note, while 1870h:XVII and XVIII begin by making the point more briefly: “to be copied.” Lastly, on 1870i:XXIII Livingstone has added the single word “copied” between two paragraphs, again apparently referencing the diary’s relational status.</p>

This page opens with a note that the page is "to be copied into Journal."</span></p>

<p>In at least one significant instance, Livingstone also uses the 1870 Field Diary in a different relational manner – to serve as a draft copy of a despatch to Lord Stanley (15 Nov. 1870). This despatch occupies a significant portion of the second gathering (1870i:XLI-LXI), begins with a note that it is a “copy” (page 1870i:XLI), and ends with Livingstone recording that he “copied the foregoing despatch” (1870i:LXII).</p>

<p>The presence of this letter, therefore, distinguishes the 1870 Field Diary from most of Livingstone’s other final diaries (excepting the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>, which contains a draft of an unsent letter), but reiterates a practice seen in the Unyanyembe Journal, which contains copies of multiple letters. From a broader perspective, the letter thus underscores that Livingstone uses the 1870 Field Diary to store multiple kinds of information: it is a place to record observations that exist nowhere else; it serves as a temporary repository for notes that would be expanded and revised in the Unyanyembe Journal; and, at least in this instance, it also provides a backup copy of an important letter that might be lost in transit (also see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link6">The big stain</a>).</p>

<p class="space2">Livingstone’s manuscript pages are put in order in four different ways. First, the pages that comprise the first gathering are, most obviously, bound together as a whole, presumably by Livingstone. Second, Livingstone has dated the entries in the first and second gatherings.<a id="link4" name="link4"></a> Third, Livingstone has numbered the pages in the second gathering with Roman numerals from I to CI. Finally, a series of unidentified archivists has numbered the manuscript pages, although such numbering is not consistent.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Sequencing by date.</strong> As noted, Livingstone has dated the entries in both first and second gatherings of the 1870 Field Diary. Livingstone dates successive entries in the first gathering as 17 August 1870 and 24 August 1870. However, since the opening pages of this gathering are missing, it is reasonable to presume that there was at least one date preceding the above two dates.</p>

A rare instance of a dated entry in the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870b).</span></p>

<p>Livingstone dates the pages of the second gathering with a range of dates running from 18 August 1870 to 22 March 1871. (Note: the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a> picks up the thread directly afterward, with its first entry dated 23 March 1871.) In other words, there is an overlap between the dating of the first and second gatherings. The overlap suggests that the first gathering might be treated as a separate document, one intermediate between Field Diary XIII and the 1870 Field Diary – although we have not taken this course in the present edition.</p>

By this point, Livingstone had run out of space in Field Diary XIII (Livingstone 1869) and so was using the 1870 Field Diary both for reflection and to record each passing day. As a result, this page contains entries for all the dates in the following sequence: 17-20 February 1871.</span></p>

<p>Date-keeping in the second gathering is not continuous, at least initially. From August 1870 to the end of January 1871, Livingstone writes a dated entry only every few days or, sometimes, every few weeks (for instance, there is no dated entry for September 1870, although one of the missing pages transcribed by Agnes does mention a September date; see 1870d:{21}). This seemingly sporadic dating in fact works in tandem with Field Diary XIII, as we discuss elsewhere (<a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-composition-practices">Livingstone’s Composition Practices</a>).</p>

<p>Specifically, Field Diary XIII serves Livingstone as a calendar, where he records a date (if nothing else) for each successive day, while he uses the 1870 Field Diary to expand upon particular ideas. However, once Livingstone runs out of space in Field Diary XIII (mid February 1871), the last pocket-book remaining to him in Manyema, the function of the 1870 Field Diary changes. Although Livingstone continues to use the 1870 Field Diary for longer entries, after 8 February 1871 the dating becomes nearly continuous to the end of the diary.</p>

In contrast to the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone dates the \'Retrospect\' at the end rather than at the beginning.</span></p>

<p>Livingstone’s imposition of dates in both the first and second gatherings takes a rather straightforward form. Not every page of the diary contains a date. The date always heads or precedes the given diary entry (by contrast, Livingstone dates the 10 March 1870 “Retrospect” [Livingstone 1870a] at the end of the document). Sometimes Livingstone writes out the full date: “17th August 1870” (1870b:[7]) “16th January 1871” (1871a:LXXVI [v.1]). Sometimes he uses only the day and month: “19th Octr [1870]” (1870h:XVII), “10th Decr [1870]” (1870j:LXIX), “13th Feby [1871]” (1871b:LXXXVI).</p>

<p>Most often, especially after 8 February 1871, when the dating becomes nearly continuous, he uses only the date: “17th [February 1871]” (1871b:LXXXVII), “3d [March 1871]” (1871e:XCI). With only one exception – “Decr 23d 1870” (1870k:LXXIII) – he always follows the order of day, month, year; the month may be written in full or abbreviated. Finally, in one instance he includes the day of the week – “16th Friday [February 1871]” (1871b:LXXXVI) – and in one instance he gives a date range rather than a single date for a dated entry: “17th -18th [March 1871]" (1871e:CI).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Sequencing by Roman numerals.</strong> In addition to dates, Livingstone orders the pages of the second gathering by using Roman numerals. Usually these numerals appear in the upper left-hand corner of the page, directly preceding the text (XXXVI which appears in the upper-right margin of the relevant page [1870i:XXXVI] is the only exception) and are often of a slightly larger size than the rest of the text on the page. Sometimes a period or a dash follows the numeral, sometimes not. The numerals may be underlined, overlined, both, or neither.</p>

<p>Pages V-IX and XV-XVI are missing, so we do not know how the numerals appeared on those pages. Page LXXVII also appears to be missing, but in this case the unbroken sequence of undertext pages in this segment of the diary suggests that Livingstone may have forgotten to create this page; alternately, since Livingstone has not numbered the verso of 1871a:LXXVI [v.1], that page may be page LXXVII (but see below).</p>

<p>The numerals in the second gathering run from I to CI, with a few exceptions (the pages of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>, therefore, follow directly, being numbered CII to CLXIII). Livingstone has not numbered the first page of the second gathering (1870c:I), although its placement on the manuscript leaf that includes pages II, III, and IV suggests that the relevant page is indeed page I. The numeral LV appears twice, on both the recto and verso of the given leaf (1870i:LV [v.1], LV [v.2]), although the number on the verso appears to be an after-the-fact addition (see below). Uniquely, numeral XXI appears both at the beginning of the relevant page (1870i:XXI; upper left-hand corner, in a form that suggests Livingstone forgot it initially, then wrote it into the available space) and at the end (lower right-hand corner).</p>

As the spectral image shows, this page experienced significant saturation that wiped away some of the text, especially in the upper left-hand corner. To compensate, Livingstone reinked some of the text in that spot, including his Roman numeral.</span></p>

<p>The available evidence suggests that Livingstone wrote the numerals at a variety of times relative to the main text. Usually, he wrote the numerals concurrently with the main text, as the layout of the page and placement of the numeral makes clear in the relevant cases. In some instances, however, it appears that Livingstone pre-numbered his pages (cf. the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods#link5">1871 Field Diary</a>), as the placement and layout suggest concurrent composition, but the ink used to write the numeral differs from the main diary text (e.g., 1870i:XXVII, XXXI, XXXII).</p>

<p>In other cases, the numerals appear to be an after-the-fact addition, as they are crammed into the available space and sometimes written in a different shade of ink (1870i:XXI, XXXVI, XXIX, LX; 1871b:LXXX) or, in a one instance, appear to be in Zingifure, a local seed-based ink (1870i:LV [v.2]). Finally, Livingstone seems to have reinked a few numerals that became smeared due to page saturation (e.g., 1870i:XLIV, LIV; 1870k:LXXV).</p>

In contrast to his usual practice in the second gathering of the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone did not write Roman numerals on these two pages. The character of the ink on the first (left; top in mobile) suggests that it was written concurrently with the text on the other side (Livingstone 1870f:XIV [v.1]). The character of the ink on the second (right; bottom) is neither consistent across the page, as this spectral image shows, nor with the ink of the diary entry on the other side of the page (Livingstone 1871a:LXXVI [v.2]), making it unclear when Livingstone drew this map.</span></td>

</table>

<p>Additionally, the versos of both 1870f:XIV [v.1] and 1871a:LXXVI [v.1] present unusual cases, as both versos (respectively, 1870f:[XIV v.2] and 1871a:[LXXVI v.2]) contain maps and are not numbered. This may indicate that Livingstone drew these maps on the undertexts before composing the diary, which he then did not consider as including the maps; or he may not have numbered these pages because they contain maps rather than diary text proper; or one or more other reasons.</p>

<p class="space2">The ink used to create these two maps further complicates the situation. The ink on 1870f:[XIV v.2] appears to be the same as on the recto, suggesting sequential composition (as do, incidentally, internal reference between the map on the verso and text on the recto). <a id="link6" name="link6"></a>The ink on the 1871a:[LXXVI v.2] appears to be different from the recto and, indeed, from other pages directly before and after in sequence, suggesting that this page was written at a different time (for more on the topics covered in this paragraph and the previous, see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1#link9">Preliminary Composition and Additions</a> and <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1#link10">Reinking and Revisions</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Sequencing by archival numbers.</strong> This method of sequencing disrupts the three previous schemas, resulting from the dispersal of the 1870 Field Diary. As it exists today, the diary is scattered among three repositories: The British Library, the David Livingstone Centre, and the National Library of Scotland. As a reflection of this, each of the three sets of repositories holdings also bear one or more archival number sequences, all in gray pencil. These archival numbers impose a fourth type of ordering on the pages of the 1870 Field Diary.</p>

<p>The British Library pages (1870c:I-IV) appear on the recto and verso of a single leaf (f. 169) as part of manuscript volume under shelfmark Add. MS. 50184. As a result, an unknown archivist has numbered the upper right-hand corner of the recto of this leaf (1870c:IV of Livingstone’s diary) as “169.” On this same leaf, the text “57B” appears circled and at a diagonal in the upper left-hand corner (under Livingstone’s “IV”), but the significance of this text is unknown.</p>

This page has two archival numbers added in another hand, in the upper and lower right-hand corners.</span></p>

<p>The majority of pages held by the David Livingstone Centre – all of the first gathering (1870b, DLC shelfmark: 297a); and parts of the second gathering (1870h:XVII-XX, DLC shelfmark: 297d; and 1870j:LXII-LXIX, DLC shelfmark: 297e) – do not bear any sort of archival numbers. However, one or more unknown archivists have numbered the pages 1870b as follows:</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:1em; padding-left:2em;">
	<li>XIV [v.1]: “1” (upper right-hand corner), “3” (lower right-hand corner)</li>
	<li>[XIV v.2], verso: “2” (lower left-hand corner, if the page is viewed on the horizontal axis, with the rivers running down from the top of the page)</li>
	<li>LXXVI [v.1], recto: “4” (upper right-hand corner)</li>
	<li>[LXXVI v.2], verso: “7” (upper right-hand corner, if the printed text on the page is turned right way up)</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the National Library of Scotland has placed all its leaves of the 1870 Field Diary under the shelfmark MS. 10703. The majority of these leaves (1870e, 1870i, 1870k, 1871b), on the recto sides only, bear archival numbers in the upper right-hand corner that run from “1” to “31.” The only exceptions to this rule are the two leaves from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> (1871e) which bear numbers in the upper right-hand corner on both the recto and verso sides, running from “32” to “35.” The “MS. 10703” shelfmark also appears on the first of the Pall Mall Budget leaves in the upper left-hand corner (or upside-down and in the lower right-hand corner, depending on how one orients the page).</p>

<p class="space2">The text of the 1870 Field Diary suggests that its main purpose is to serve as a longer record of Livingstone’s life in the field, a function that shifts the diary away from Livingstone’s other field diaries of the period and towards the more expansive Unyanyembe Journal. In actual fact, however, Livingstone uses the 1870 Field Diary to capture a heterogeneous set of materials, many of which bear no direct relation to the main dated entries. <a id="link8" name="link8"></a>These materials complicate definitive generic categorization and include a copy of a letter, rough decontextualized field notes, maps, and calculations. The materials, like the dated entries and various numbering schemes, also play a role in structuring the final manuscript.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Letter to Lord Stanley.</strong> 1870i:XLI-LXI contain a copy of a letter that Livingstone drafted and subsequently sent to Lord Stanley during this period.

In the nineteenth century, it was published still during Livingstone’s lifetime in Parliamentary Papers (Livingstone 1872a). The letter begins with an address to “The Right Honourable Lord Stanley” and concludes with Livingstone’s signature.</p>

<p class="space2">As subsequent text indicates, Livingstone handed the final version of the letter to the Arab trader Muhammad Bogarib for delivery “into the consul’s hands at Zanzibar” (1870j:LXII). <a id="link9" name="link9"></a>Livingstone’s decision to draft the letter in the diary underscores the letters significance to Livingstone, as it was the only letter thus drafted although concurrently Livingstone wrote other letters to “Tom Agnes - Young Webb Oswell Dr Hamilton Sir Roderick Sir Bartle Frere - Tracey - Stearns of Bombay - Maclear = Bleek Brother John In Canada” (1870j:LXII).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Field notes.</strong> In composing the other field diaries from his last journey, Livingstone’s practice was to place random series of field notes at the end of his diaries. The <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>, for instance, which continues directly from the 1870 Field Diary and might be considered the second half of the latter, has such notes at the end. These field notes, often dated, might include lists of porters, rainfall measurements, vocabularies, stations on routes, illustrations, and a diverse range of other materials. Four pages of the 1870 Field Diary also contain these field notes.</p>

In the middle of a diary entry, Livingstone boxes off a segment where he notes the names of three rivers.</span></p>

<p>The first set of such notes (1870h:XVII) takes the form of three river names that Livingstone has placed on a single line a box: “Lonzua Luaze Luanzo.” These rivers have no obvious connection to the surrounding text, but two of them do appear on the map that Livingstone has drawn lower down on the page.</p>

<p>The second set (1870h:XIX) appears above a double-line that separates out of the rest of the page’s text. In this case the notes take a more heterogeneous form: a note about an Arab trader (“Syde bin Salem Buraschid family Lumke”), an African word of indeterminate purpose (“Megongo”), and a few alternate African words for “fish” (“soga – Guke” and “sangaro”).</p>

On this page, in a section marked off with a horizontal line, Livingstone records vocabulary collected in Manyema.</span></p>

<p>The third set (1870k:LXXI) appears below a single line that also separates out the rest of the page’s text. In this case, the notes combine elucidation of familial relationships among a few Africans and, apparently, a brief outline of milestones on the travel routes to these individuals.</p>

<p class="space2">Finally, Livingstone again separates out the fourth set of notes (1870i:XXVII) above a single line. <a id="link10" name="link10"></a>This set consists of three salutations, one from a Lualaba river population (“Ikwena alumwa”), two from a Manyema population (“a ko sema iamwu” to men, “Doshanga kakaka” to women).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Maps.</strong> The 1870 Field Diary contains three maps of various complexities. Livingstone created some of these maps concurrently with the diary entries; others may have been created earlier (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/structuring-1870-field-diary#link5">Sequencing by Roman Numeral</a>). The first map (1870f:[XIV v.2]), which Livingstone sets at “about 1° South Lat[itude],” depicts a series of 10 rivers running west to east, all flowing “to Uerere Lake” in the east (the lake itself does not appear on the map). The map also includes a dotted line that marks the route of two Arab traders (Ramadan and Hassani) across these rivers and a series of boxed in annotations around the map.</p>

This unique segment of text contains a calculation in the upper left-hand corner, a sloping horizontal line, and a small map in the lower left-hand corner.</span></p>

<p>The second map (1870h:XVII) shows “River in Lake Tanganyika or Lacustrine River” and its major affluents. The map also marks the spot of Ujiji and the regions of Loanda, Uzige, Urundi, and Ugoma. The third map appears on the final page of the diary (1871e:CI) and consists only of a looping line for “Kanayumbe loop &amp; river.”</p>

<p class="space2"><a id="link11" name="link11"></a>(Note: Four pages of Livingstone’s diary [1870h:XVII-XX] are also composed on the back of Baker’s map of the Albert N’yanza [Livingstone 1870h:[map]], to which map Livingstone has added one set of calculations, but not otherwise marked.)</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Calculations.</strong> The 1870 Field Diary includes a handful of standalone calculations. The first set appears below the Baker map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]) and involves the latitudes of the villages Ujiji and Nyangwe and the Lindi River. The second set (1870i:LII) consists of three multiplication problems and appears to pre-date the main diary text as it lies below and perpendicular to that text. 1871b:LXXX has another multiplication problem, boxed off from the main text, but of the same ink and so, presumably written at the same time. 1871e:CI also has one simple calculation, partly boxed off, and involves the addition of pieces of cloth.</p>

<p>Finally, 1871a:[LXXVI v.2] is a special case and contains a range of calculations in different inks, some of which appear to pre-date the main text. Most of these calculations involve subtraction of unknown purpose, with at least one involving degrees (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link15">Additional Notes on the Undertexts</a> for more on the calculations).</p>

<p>A few other manuscript features merit a brief mention. One such feature is Livingstone’s use of horizontal lines across the page to separate various parts of the text. Most often Livingstone uses these lines to mark where a new diary entry begins (1870i:XXIX, XXXII, LXV; 1870j:LXIX; 1870k:LXX, LXXXV; 1871e:XCVI, CI), sometimes to separate paragraphs (1870i:XXVI, 1870j:LXVII), and sometimes to section off text that breaks the flow of a given entry, such as a longer addition (1870e:XII, 1870i:XXIX) or a random set of field notes (1870h:XIX, 1870i:XXVII, 1870k:LXXI). The lines are usually straight and single, but in one instance Livingstone uses two lines (1870h:XIX) and in two cases the line slants around various bits of text (1871e:XCVI, second half of CI). As a whole, Livingstone’s use of such lines is the exception not the rule, and his decision when and not to use them appears random.</p>

On this page, Livingstone has marked off different segments of text with two separate horizontal lines.</span></p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary also contains a handful of anomalous textual features. In a few cases, Livingstone boxes off a small segment of text, such as a note (1870b:[40]), annotations on a map (1870h:[map]), or a set of words (1870h:XVII). Two pages contain flourishes to correct ink flow (1870b:[7], 1871a:LXXVI [v.1]), a feature that becomes much more prominent in the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-manuscript-structure#link10">1871 Field Diary</a>.</p>

The processed image of this page removes Livingstone main diary text and reveals the squiggle to correct ink flow that lies beneath that text.</span></p>

<p>Finally, Livingstone tends to fill all available space on a given page with text owing to the shortage of writing paper during this phase of his final travels. However, in a few instances Livingstone leaves a notable amount of blank space on the page without indication as to its purpose (see 1870b:[6], 1870i:LV [v.2], 1871a:[LXXVI v.2], 1871b:LXXXVI, 1871e:XC). Other than a minor calculation, Livingstone also leaves the entire surface of Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]) unmarked (however, see the discussion in <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link8">Third sub-gathering [Livingstone 1870h]</a>).</p>

Contrary to his usual practice, Livingstone has left a significant section of this page blank and may have intended to add entries for the missing dates (14 and 15 Feb. 1871) at a later time – a point that also suggests that he may not have written all the entries of the 1870 Field Diary in strict chronological order.</span></p>

<p>It should also be noted that annotations in another hand appear on two pages of the diary (1870h:XVII, XVIII) plus just below Baker’s map (1870h:[map]). These annotations correlate Livingstone’s handwritten text with the text as published posthumously in the <em>Last Journals </em>(1874) and appear to be in the hand of Rev. James McNair, founder of the David Livingstone Centre.</p>

<p>These additional manuscript features underscore the many ways that the diary produces meaning and, in turn, the need for any critical analysis of the diary to be attentive to such elements.</p>

<p class="rtecenter">*</p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary, therefore, derives it structure from a variety of components, including its relation to other texts, diverse ordering schemes, the nature of its content, and other textual elements. The subsequent sections of this essay review the passage of the 1870 Field Diary across hands, space, and time, and end with a new history and chronology of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Field Diary XVI is the last diary Livingstone completed in his life, and its almost 200 pages record his struggles with ill health, heavy rains, hunger, and misdirection. Livingstone and his men head south to Lake Bangweolo and then circle around the lake to the south-east. Throughout, they are plagued with difficult travel due to the extensive marshy region, made worse by the "wet wet wet sloppy weather" (Livingstone 1872h:[67]). In addition, Livingstone mistrusts local directions, which do not jibe with his previous calculations, resulting in confusion that is made worse by his anal bleeding and scarcity of food.</p>

<p>This diary contains several meditations on his use of force with Africans. He and his men are shut out of local villages or the villagers run away upon their approach. This also makes obtaining food, guides, and geographical information very difficult during this time. Livingstone attributes this to a fear of guns, as when he believes himself to have been "treated scurvily by [chief] Chungu [...] It is terror of guns" (Livingstone 1872h:[53]).</p>

<p>Perhaps because of this, Livingstone continues to assert authority over local situations but also question his approach. For instance, when he enters a village where "some had bought or stolen little children," he "ordered them to be returned." When one man "swore that he did not know from whom he got the child," Livingstone "gave him one blow as a thief &amp; ordered him out of the camp" (Livingstone 1872h:[48]). He even goes so far, in a different situation, to punish local villagers against the desires of their headman (Livingstone 1872h:[169]).</p>

<p>At the same time, however, Livingstone also wonders if the difficulties he encounters on this portion of his journey stem from not being authoritative enough: "I have gone among the whole population kindly &amp; fairly but I fear that I must now act more rigidly for when they hear that we have submitted to injustice they at once conclude that we are fair game for all" (Livingstone 1872h:[97]). He ponders whether shows of strength or mediation are best to achieve his ends, though nowhere does he question his essential authority or the morality of those ends.</p>

<p>Livingstone writes Field Diary XVI in the same kind of book as <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-xv-overview">Field Diary XV</a>, a black flip-top with a metal fastener at the bottom. It, too, contains an 1868 calendar, though it has a printed page pasted to cover it. This diary is notable for citing the women traveling with Livingstone\'s group. Written primarily in grey pencil, with additions in red pencil, the upside-down section runs from the end of the diary to page [137]. The section contains many rainfall records; even when in great pain, Livingstone\'s scientific observations and calculations continue, including geographical and botanical information. The back section is primarily short notes and lists, mixed with focused narrative accounts about singular incidents. Livingstone describes in detail the process of a caterpillar laying eggs, as well as the story of how he and his men saved a little girl who had been abandoned.</p>

<p>The manuscript of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary forms the last third of a longer sequence of manuscripts that record Livingstone’s travels in Manyema, a region that today lies in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These manuscripts encompasses over 160 numbered pages (the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries) as well as several unnumbered fragments (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:275-77, Field Diaries 34-39).</p>

<p>During his last expedition (1866-73), Livingstone usually used small "pocket-books" or "metallic note-books" to keep his diary (Waller, in Livingstone 1874,1:iv). When time permitted, Livingstone expanded the notes in the pocket-books, while copying them over into the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), a single large volume that posthumously became the basis of the<em> Last Journals</em> (1874). Livingstone filled thirteen pocket-books in the years before his meeting with Stanley (1866-71) and an additional four during and after his time with Stanley (1871-73). The Unyanyembe Journal and all of the pocket-books (numbered by Livingstone from I to XVII) were brought back to Britain and survive to the present day (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:273, 275-76, Journal 11 and Field Diaries 14-30; Helly 1987:64-65,130).</p>

<p>However, Livingstone began to run low on pocket-books while traveling in Manyema. To compensate, he continued to write in pocket-book XIII (28 June 1869-25 Feb. 1871), but also began to compose the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries (17 Aug. 1870-3 Nov. 1871) using whatever paper he had on hand. These diaries are written over pages from an unidentified book of sermons, a map of Lake Albert from the <em>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</em>, sheets from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em> (21 Aug. 1869) and <em>The Standard</em> (24 Nov. 1869), and various old envelopes and enclosures. When a page already had printed text on it, Livingstone turned the page ninety degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise and wrote at a perpendicular angle to the printed text. In this way, he created a series of diary pages that have both "undertext" (the printed text) and "overtext" (Livingstone’s handwritten text). Once his supplies ran low and he was unable to create iron gall ink, Livingstone resorted to using ink made from a local African clothing dye that he called "Zingifure."</p>

<p>Such expedients have rendered the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries unique among Livingstone’s diaries. The physical appearance of the diaries strikingly captures the extreme and arduous circumstances under which Livingstone lived and travelled in this period of his life. Today the 1871 Field Diary in particular is in a fragile state: its pages are crumbling, and large portions of Livingstone’s handwritten text have become illegible due to fading, blotting, water damage, and other problems. Even when visible, Livingstone’s words are obscured by the printed texts over which he wrote. As a result, the manuscript of the 1871 Field Diary poses considerable challenges for its readers, especially as large segments of the diary are all but invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Although the leaves of this segment are now disassembled, their layout sequence indicates that Livingstone originally assembled the leaves into two "copy-books" (Waller, in Livingstone 1874,2:114n.). Each copy-book consisted of eight leaves (with two diary pages per folio, or four diary pages per leaf) placed one on top of the other, then folded along the middle to make a 32-page copy-book. It is not clear if Livingstone pre-numbered all the diary pages, but there is evidence that he pre-numbered at least some of them (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods">Livingstone\'s Composition Methods</a>). Whatever the case, at some point the leaf containing CXIX-CXVI (recto) and CXVII-CXVIII (verso) was torn along the middle, and one leaf became two, each with only a single diary page per side:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">first leaf: CXVI (recto) / CXVII (verso)<br />
second leaf: CXIX (recto) / CXVIII (verso)</p>

<p>As a result, this portion of the diary consists of 34 folia containing 64 diary pages, rather than 32 folia as would be expected.</p>

<p class="space2">Finally, it is worth noting that all the leaves of this segment have been laminated with a heat-set document repair tissue by the Stirling University Library Conservation Unit.

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Additional Diary Pages (11 Aug.-3 Nov. 1871).</strong> The second, fragmentary part of the 1871 Field Diary (Livingstone 1871k, 1871l, 1871m) picks up where the Nyangwe portion leaves off and continues the narrative of Livingstone’s journey back to and arrival in Ujiji (11 Aug.-3 Nov. 1871). This part ends just before the famous Livingstone-Stanley meeting. In fact, in one of the last entries Livingstone records a rumour he has heard about Stanley’s approach: "26th News from Garaganza many Arabs killed – road shut up – one Englishman there" (1871m:[1]). The leaves of this part of the diary are held by the David Livingstone Centre, the National Library of Scotland, and the Weston Library, Oxford.</p>

<p>The folia are written on various envelopes and enclosures sent to Livingstone during his travels (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods">Livingstone\'s Composition Methods</a> for additional information). It appears that this part is incomplete. Livingstone has not numbered the folia, but there are significant chronological gaps. The surviving folia span the following dates:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">Livingstone 1871k: 11 Aug.-9 Sept. 1871<br />
Livingstone 1871l: 28 Sept.-7 Oct. 1871<br />
Livingstone 1871m: 23 Oct.-3 Nov. 1871</p>

<p>Livingstone stacked the two leaves under 1871k and folded them in half to make an eight-page copy-book. Four consecutive pages of this copy-book contain diary entries, while the remaining four (also consecutive) – which were composed both before and much later than the embedded diary entries (at least 10 Mar. 1871-15 Nov. 1871) contain various calculations and astronomical observations.</p>

<p>The Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), which Livingstone wrote up from his field diaries, does contain entries for some of the missing dates, a point which suggests that there may have been other diary fragments that have not survived. Furthermore, the opening of the first page under 1871l – "28 Septr 1871 cont = Journal" – suggests that this entry continues from a previous page that has not survived. [Update note: Another Livingstone manuscript from the period, <a href="/islandora/search/liv_000022">Notebook III</a> (22 July-7 October 1871; pages [45]-[47], [50]-[52], [77]-[81]), also covers the period in question and also contains entries for many of the missing dates, thereby further reinforcing the point that some of the original diary fragments have not survived.]</p>

<p>After Stanley’s departure in February 1872, Livingstone kept a selection of his pocket-books (I to XIII, plus one from a previous expedition) in a box at Ujiji, an Arab depot on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. These pocket-books pre-dated Stanley’s arrival and served as back-ups for the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), which Livingstone had entrusted to Stanley.</p>

<p>The pocket-books remained at Ujiji after Livingstone’s death in March 1873 and were recovered by the British explorer Verney Lovett Cameron in February 1874 (Cameron 1877a,1:240-41). Cameron sent the pocket-books back to England, where Horace Waller, Livingstone’s friend and posthumous editor, received them on behalf of the Livingstone family in January 1875. Ultimately, Waller used the Unyanyembe Journal and the four pocket-books Livingstone filled during and after his time with Stanley as the primary sources for the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874), but the initial thirteen pocket-books arrived too late to be of use to Waller (Helly 1987:64-65, 130).</p>

<p class="space2">Curiously, Livingstone did not leave the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries in the box at Ujiji when he embarked on his final journey, although the diaries – like the pocket-books left at Ujiji – predated the Stanley meeting and duplicated material in the Unyanyembe Journal. Rather, Livingstone took the diaries with him, and they were in his "battered tin travelling-case" when he died. Eventually, these diaries along with "the field diaries dating from Stanley’s departure in March 1872 to Livingstone’s last entry in April 1873" accompanied Livingstone’s body back to England (Waller, in Livingstone 1874,1:v; Helly 1987:65).<a id="link7" name="link7"></a></p>

<p><strong>Production of the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></p>

<p>Livingstone’s decision to take the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries with him ensured that they were available – unlike the thirteen pocket-books that preceded them – to Waller when producing the <em>Last Journals</em>. In fact, the <em>Last Journals</em> includes a facsimile by Cooper Hodson of page CXVII of the 1871 Field Diary (Livingstone 1874,2:opposite 114; learn more about the <a href="/spectral-imaging/1871-field-diary-facsimile">facsimile</a>). Waller’s introduction also details Livingstone’s method for producing this diary: "for pocket-books gave out at last, and old newspapers, yellow with African damp, were sewn together, and his notes were written across the type with a substitute for ink made from the juice of a tree" (Waller in Livingstone 1874,1:iv).</p>

<p>Waller also twice refers to his success in transcribing the text of these newspapers:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">"An old sheet of the Standard newspaper, made into rough copy-books, sufficed for paper in the absence of all other material, and by writing across the print no doubt the notes were tolerably legible at the time. The colour of the decoction used instead of ink has faded so much that if Dr. Livingstone\'s handwriting had not at all times been beautifully clear and distinct it would have been impossible to decipher this part of his diary." (in Livingstone 1874,2:114n.)</p>

<p class="rteindent1">"To Miss [Agnes] Livingstone and to the Rev. C. A. Alington I am very much indebted for help in the laborious task of deciphering this portion of the Doctor’s journals. Their knowledge of his handwriting, their perseverance, coupled with good eyes and a strong magnifying-glass, at last made their task a complete success." (in Livingstone 1874,1:iv)</p>

<p>Yet these claims must be qualified and clarified. Although the references to "old newspapers, yellow with African damp," "the Standard newspaper," and the "decoction used instead of ink" point primarily to the 1871 Field Diary, Waller indeed had both the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries available to him. Agnes Livingstone transcribed the entire 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870b-k, 1871a-b, 1871e) and the first half of the first page of the 1871 Field Diary (1871f:CII) – while C.A. Alington transcribed the first third of the 1871 Field Diary (1871f:CII-CXXIII). These transcriptions, although faulty and incomplete, were then typeset and, after much revision, became the basis of the <em>Last Journals</em>.</p>

<p class="space2">Both Agnes Livingstone’s and a portion of C.A. Alington’s transcriptions survive and are held among the Waller Papers at the Weston Library at Oxford University (Mss. Afr. s. 16/6), as are both the original and revised versions of the typeset transcriptions (Waller Papers, Mss. Afr. s. 16/6-8 passim). Comparison of the original 1871 Field Diary, Alington’s transcription, the Unyanyembe Journal, and the published <em>Last Journals</em> shows that, despite assertions to the contrary, Waller used only the first third of the 1871 Field Diary (i.e., that part transcribed by Alington) for the final text; then the Unyanyembe Journal to cover the rest of Livingstone’s time in Nyangwe. In other words, after the last diary entry transcribed by Alington, 30 April 1871, the text of the <em>Last Journals</em> makes a radical departure from the text the 1871 Field Diary, and there is no evidence to suggest that the last two-thirds of the 1871 Field Diary were ever transcribed before the current critical edition.

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>1. The Nyangwe Segment.</strong> The history of this segment (Livingstone 1871f) is difficult to reconstruct, being both complex and not fully documented. After Waller completed his work with these leaves in 1874, it is most likely that the leaves (with one exception) passed to the Livingstone family. The family then gifted these leaves to the Scottish National Memorial to David Livingstone (now the David Livingstone Centre), although the date is uncertain. The gift might have been made as early as the late 1920s when Anna Mary Livingstone Wilson (then Livingstone’s only surviving daughter) and Hubert F. Wilson (Livingstone’s grandson) began to "gather &amp; preserve for future generations all the principal relics of Livingstone in the Birth place at Blantyre" (MacNair 1928). However, it is also possible that the gift was made after Anna Mary Livingstone’s death in 1939, or even after the end of World War II (Wilson 2011). The leaves remained at Blantyre until at least 1975 (Cunningham 1975).</p>

<p>The leaf that contains pages CXVI (recto) and CXVII (verso) represents the exception to this history. As noted above, the <em>Last Journals</em> include a partial <a href="/spectral-imaging/1871-field-diary-facsimile">facsimile</a> of CXVII. It appears that after the <em>Journals</em> was published, this leaf entered the possession of John Murray III, the publisher, and remained in the Murray family until early 1929. At that point, Sir John Murray V, the grandson of the publisher, agreed to provide this leaf together with two manuscript volumes of Livingstone’s <em>Missionary Travels</em> (see Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:265) to the Memorial "on indefinite loan" noting that "the bit of newspaper" was "fading" and would "have to be kept in a dark place when not actually being examined" (Murray V 1929). The Memorial formally received the leaf on 16 August 1929 (Cunningham 1975).</p>

<p>When in 1972 John Murray VI requested the return of the leaf – which he described as "[o]ne frame containing a portion of the journal written in Africa on a sheet of the Standard newspaper with juice from local plants instead of ink (a rather curious item)" (Murray VI 1972) – representatives of the Memorial asked for a delay in the return. A lengthy correspondence ensued, as Murray pressed his request. The exchanges between Murray and the Memorial, which still exist in the DLC "Correspondence Archives," culminated in Murray being informed that the leaf had been "‘misplaced’" (Cunningham 1975), and as late as 2009 John Murray VII indicated that he could not locate any record of what happened to the leaf (Murray VII 2009).</p>

<p>Yet evidence elsewhere indicates that by the late 1970s the John Murray Archive in London not only held the "‘misplaced’" leaf, but, intriguingly, all the other leaves that make up the Nyangwe Field Diary proper. This evidence suggests that Memorial representatives eventually found the leaf and provided it to the National Library of Scotland, where the all the leaves of the diary were copied for the NLS as part of the Livingstone Documentation Project (Clendennen and Casada 1981). As a result, for a time the NLS held the complete set of originals alongside photocopies under the shelfmark MS. 10717. Finally, the NLS – erroneously it appears – handed the entire set of original leaves to the John Murray Archive: "The originals, at one time part of [the MS.10717] deposit, have since been returned to the owners, John Murray, publishers, London” (Anon. 1992,8:157).</p>

<p>These details, in turn, correspond to the information in the Livingstone Catalogue of Documents. The Catalogue places the leaves in the Murray Archive while also noting that they were previously held by the Memorial (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:277, Field Diary 37). Unfortunately, the relevant portion of the "Slip Catalogue" – i.e., the original notes which Gary Clendennen and Ian Cunningham used to produce the relevant entry in Catalogue of Documents, and which Clendennen was kind enough to copy for Adrian S. Wisnicki in 2010 – provides no further information.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, an attempt in 2009 to find the 1871 Field Diary in the John Murray Archive (which the National Library of Scotland purchased in 2005) failed to discover either the leaves or any information on their whereabouts. The diary was "rediscovered" at the David Livingstone Centre (as the Memorial has also been called since 1999) only after an extensive search by Anne Martin, a volunteer archivist, at the behest of Adrian S. Wisnicki, then director of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> and now also director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>. Martin’s search located half the diary leaves under the shelfmark 297b (including the Murray leaf), with the other half being found in a second, undocumented location (now shelfmark 297c). As a result, the only clue to the full history of the diary from 1975 to 2009 comes from the 297b card index entry that records that these leaves (Livingstone 1871f:CXVI-CXIX and CXXXII [v.2]-CLXIII) as well as two from 1870 Field Diary (Livingstone 1870f and 1871a) were gifted to the Centre by Hubert F. Wilson at some indefinite point (Wilson, Livingstone’s grandson, died on 9 February 1976).</p>

<p>The entry also indicates that the leaves were transferred for conservation to Stirling University in March 1986, then returned to the Centre in May 1987, where they have remained until the present day. It seems likely that the additional leaves (1871f:CII-CXV, CXX-CXXXIII [v.1]) followed a similar trajectory as they have received the same conservation treatment as the leaves under the shelfmark 297b. Yet the card index entry fails to resolve how, when, or why in the late 1970s and/or early 1980s the 1871 Field Diary was transferred from the Centre to the Murray Archive and back again. It is also not clear why the verso of the card index entry includes a handwritten addition recording "13 sheets of newsprint / book pages" when there are only 12 leaves under the 297b shelfmark. Consequently, at this stage it is possible to provide only a partial history of these leaves; significant gaps must remain until further evidence emerges.</p>

<p class="space2">[Update note: Since the first edition publication of the present edition in 2012, the David Livingstone Centre has restored the leaf with pages CXVI (recto) and CXVII (verso) to the John Murray Archive at the National Library of Scotland.]<a id="link10" name="link10"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>2. Additional Diary Pages.</strong> These leaves (Livingstone 1870k, 1870l, 1870m) have a much simpler, if also partly undocumented history. The leaves were probably among "the makeshift papers relating to the period in 1871 before Stanley arrived" that accompanied Livingstone’s body to England in 1874 (Helly 1987:65). Henceforth, the Livingstone family presumably took possession of the leaves.</p>

<p><strong>a. Livingstone 1870k.</strong> In 1965, Hubert F. Wilson, the grandson of David Livingstone, gifted the leaves that constitute this item along with other parts of the 1870 Field Diary (1870e, 1870i, 1870k, 1871b, 1871e) as well as Livingstone\'s 10 March 1870 "Retrospect" (1870a) to the National Library of Scotland. The leaves have remained there ever since (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:277, Field Diary 38).</p>

<p><strong>b. Livingstone 1870kl.</strong> At some point this leaf passed from the Livingstone family to the David Livingstone Centre, although there is no direct evidence to support or undermine this assertion. Today the leaf resides between the pages of another Livingstone copy-book relating to the same period (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:276, Field Diary 33).</p>

<p><strong>c. Livingstone 1870m.</strong> At some point, probably in the late-nineteenth century, these leaves passed from the Livingstone family to Horace Waller’s permanent possession and were among his papers when he died. "The Bodleian Library Record" of April 1940, which relates to the Waller Papers as a whole but does not discuss these specific leaves, notes that "This collection of letters and private papers belonged to the Rev. Horace Waller (1832-1896) and has been presented to Bodley by his daughters, Lady Hunt and Miss Grace Waller." Today the leaves are kept at the Weston Library, Oxford University (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:277, Field Diary 39).</p>

The letter required conservation because pieces of the letter were detached, torn, or folded over. These issues arose partly from the adverse environmental circumstances in which the letter was originally written and transported, and partly from the fact that Livingstone wrote the letter with iron gall ink, which can contain a corrosive metallic component and thus deteriorate the paper upon which it is used.</p>

<p>In performing her work, Van Dyke first removed the letter from its original frame, which consisted of a double-sided tongue and groove frame assembly, and which presented the letter between two pieces of glass. She then placed individual sheets onto a working light box, and during a period of approximately two days, repaired detached portions of the letter and reinforced breaks along the edges with a toned tenjugo Japanese paper and a thermoset (gently heat-activated) adhesive, which, unlike aqueous adhesives, will not accelerate the deterioration mechanism of iron gall ink.</p>

<p>Alongside this work, Van Dyke also gently humidified and opened up folds, creases, and flaps, thereby revealing previously hidden portions of the writing.</p>

<p>The last phase of the treatment involved overall humidification and flattening of the letter through a Gore-Tex humidification package. The letter was then placed between acid-free lens tissue and blotters and was allowed to dry under weight for ten days.</p>

<p>For transportation, Van Dyke secured the letter with conservationally sound, museum-quality materials. She photo-cornered the actual pages of the letter into a non-buffered high alpha cellulose paper folder, which itself was placed into a black matboard folder. The package was then surrounded with coroplast so as to create a rigid exterior layer, which in turn was wrapped in plastic in order to secure the letter from hazards such as rain or snow.</p>

<p>The letter was therefore ready for delivery on 26 February 2010, the date slated for the spectral imaging. Yet that morning the transport team awoke to discover that a massive snowstorm had arrived and that the northeastern United States was blanketed in snow.</p>

<p>The letter was ready, but the team deemed it in no one’s interest to test the survival capabilities of the letter one more time. As a result, the imaging was rescheduled, and Adrian S. Wisnicki (project director), Jeff Drouin (technological assistant), and Heather F. Ball (research assistant) finally transported the letter to Baltimore and back on 4 March 2010.</p>

<p>The opportunity to work on this project has been both amazing and humbling – amazing because it has brought me into contact with so many wonderful people in so many fields, at so many different institutions; humbling because throughout the project I have never ceased to marvel at the kindness of these individuals (including the tireless members of my team), at the generosity of these institutions, and at the willingness of all to help and give their time selflessly whenever I contacted them. Please consider this project to be yours also. It will help me discharge the lifetime’s debt I’ve now built up with many of you.</p>

<p>If your name does not appear below and it should, please let me know. A few obvious names are missing, but that’s because I’ve named you Honorary Members of our <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-team-1">project team</a> in recognition of the exceptional support you’ve provided to our work.</p>

<p>Thank you very much to everyone. I am grateful beyond words. You have let me dream my biggest dream yet.</p>

<p>In addition to development of core data, LEAP empowered the project team to overhaul the <em>Livingstone Online</em> site top to bottom. This involved, first, converting the site to <a href="http://islandora.ca/" target="_blank">Islandora</a>, an open-source software framework combining <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> for its front end and <a href="http://fedorarepository.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> for its back end, and, second, redesigning the interface to cater to modern user sensibilities and expectations. The first element would allow the site to be integrated into the UCLA Digital Library collections and so be maintained and preserved long-term as part of those collections (as was then anticipated). The second would hopefully facilitate access to the site\'s materials by a variety of users.</p>

<p>[qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] had begun a preliminary conversion of the site to Drupal while still at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (and prior to LEAP), with student programmers [qtip: Adam Colton|Adam Colton (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Web developer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], [qtip: Annie Lin|Annie Lin (Undergraduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Web developer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], and [qtip: Eliza Albert|Eliza Albert (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Web developer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.]. Once LEAP began, Wisnicki brought the Drupal site files to UNL, where [qtip: Karin Dalziel|Karin Dalziel (Digital Designer and Development Specialist, Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). CDRH co-lead for LEAP.] set about enhancing the conversion and beginning the work of redesigning the site\'s aesthetic dimension. When the Drupal site files went over to UCLA in early 2014, Wisnicki convened a sub-group of project team members (himself, [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], and students [qtip: Angela Aliff|Angela Aliff (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Research assistant and interface designer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], [qtip: Ashanka Kumari|Ashanka Kumari (Graduate Student, University of Louisville). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], and [qtip: Erin Cheatham|Erin Cheatham (Graduate Student, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.]) to focus on site redesign. The subgroup soon became known as the LEAP Aesthetic Action Team.</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-size:17px;"><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><strong>Site Levels for the New <em>Livingstone Online</em></strong></span></span><br />
<em>Home page</em> (Level 1) - Links to section pages<br />
<em>Section Pages</em> (Level 2) - Six, each with links to content pages<br />
<em>Secondary Content Pages</em> (Level 3) - Critical essays and similar materials<br />
<em>Primary Content Pages</em> (Level 4) - Images, transcriptions, metadata for Livingstone manuscripts<br />
<em>Secondary Content Page Variants</em> (Level 5) - Browse and search options for manuscripts</p>

<p>Given the broad audience of <em>Livingstone Online,</em> the team envisioned a site for a range of users and drew inspiration from a variety of model sites (e.g., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.cast83.com/" target="_blank">CAST83</a>), not just other academic websites. Lead by Wisnicki and Aliff, a new site began to emerge, with more images, vibrant colors, and visually-guided navigation. A series of detailed mockups laid out the specifications for this new site.</p>

<p>The new <em>Livingstone Online</em> would also feature numerous critical and historical essays. During the first year of LEAP, therefore, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S.

<p>One of the key goals was to foster an awareness of Livingstone\'s complex and often controversial legacy. To help articulate this, [qtip: Joanne Ichimura|Joanne Ichimura (Archivist, Special Collections, SOAS Library, University of London). Institutional contact for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], [qtip: Justin Livingstone|Justin Livingstone (Research Fellow, Queen’s University Belfast). Associate project scholar for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], and [qtip: Jared McDonald|Jared McDonald (Lecturer, University of the Free State). Associate project scholar and lead contact for South African research for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] kindly shared versions of materials related to the 2013 bicentenary exhibit at SOAS, University of London. The inclusion of these materials on the new <em>Livingstone Online</em> would play an important role in [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Megan Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.]\'s efforts to avoid perpetuating colonialist modes of representing Livingstone\'s legacy and the non-Western regions he visited.</p>

<p>As part of the legacy essay review, [qtip: Kumari|Ashanka Kumari (Graduate Student, University of Louisville). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] also worked with Wisnicki and original <em>Livingstone Online</em> team members to draft a <a href="/about-site/brief-history-livingstone-online-2004-2013">history of the project</a> for the years 2004-13. Finally, Wisnicki and Ward, with assistance from Kumari, also expanded and updated the <em>Livingstone Online</em> <a href="/resources/david-livingstone-bibliography">bibliography</a> to encompass a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary materials. They then created a custom Zotero library of these materials in order to facilitate collaborative development, while enabling future export of this bibliographic data in a variety of formats, such as TEI, MODS, and RDF.</p>

<p>As all project facets developed, the LEAP team took steps to inform scholars, stakeholders, and general users of project progress. During the first year of LEAP, team members spoke about the project at the Smithsonian, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the University of Glasgow, Temple University, the Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science (DePaul University), the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) 2014 conference in Chicago, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\'s Digital Humanities Faculty Fellows Forum.</p>

<p>In November 2014, slightly more than a year from the project\'s beginning, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] arranged a series of meetings in Scotland and England, during which he delivered project updates to representatives of the David Livingstone Centre, National Library of Scotland, University College London, SOAS, University of London, and the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford. These meetings included a visit with [qtip: Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson|Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson. Great great grandson of David Livingstone.] (great great grandson of David Livingstone), whose family had been strong supporters of <em>Livingstone Online</em> since the inception of the project in 2004.</p>

<p>The LEAP team also began to reach out to new audiences through the newly created <a href="https://livingstoneonline.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/livingstone13d" target="_blank">Twitter account</a>. Regular tweets covered all aspects of the project while a range of blog posts sought to define the <em>Livingstone Online</em> site, its goals, and its content for a broad audience.</p>

<p>LEAP\'s outreach program comprised the final element of the dissemination work, led jointly by LEAP team members ([qtip: Kate Simpson|Kate Simpson (Graduate Student, Edinburgh Napier University). Project scholar and UK outreach coordinator for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], [qtip: Megan Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.]), staff of the David Livingstone Centre ([qtip: Martha B. Findlay|Martha B. Findlay (Learning Officer, David Livingstone Centre).], [qtip: Alison Ritchie|Alison Ritchie (Property Manager, David Livingstone Centre). Institutional contact for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.]), and schools local to the David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre. In the fall of 2013, Simpson and Findlay began work on this program with a "pre-pilot" that encouraged local school children to interact with Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the experience of the pre-pilot, Ward and Simpson developed a <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-outreach-worksheets">series of worksheets</a> that would encourage students to explore relevant historical themes (e.g., slavery, global citizenship, African culture) through <em>Livingstone Online</em>. In this they were assisted by volunteer [qtip: Alastair Simpson|Alastair Simpson (Volunteer, David Livingstone Centre).] who provided worksheet design and layout support.</p>

<p>The worksheets were tested at the DLC with school groups and revised with the goal of making them freely available via <em>Livingstone Online</em>. In addition, Simpson also reached out to [qtip: Lynne Robertson|Lynne Robertson (Senior Education Officer, Education Scotland)] at Education Scotland, a Scottish governmental body responsible for supporting teaching and learning. Robertson agreed to link to and endorse the <em>Livingstone Online</em> worksheets. With work on the pilot complete, Ward and [qtip: Samantha Fitch|Samantha Fitch (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], another member of the LEAP team, then took the first steps towards designing a US version of the outreach program.</p>

<p>Website implementation was the last step in the 1.5-year arc of development that drew on the concentrated efforts of LEAP\'s project team. [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], with guidance from [qtip: Toth|Michael B. Toth (President, R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for LEAP and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], interfaced with [qtip: McAulay|Lisa McAulay (Librarian, UCLA Digital Library Program). Institutional co-lead for LEAP.] and [qtip: Davison|Stephen Davison (Director, UCLA Digital Library Program). Institutional co-lead for LEAP.] to direct this aspect of LEAP. In a separate process, Wisnicki also worked directly with [qtip: James Cummings|James Cummings (Senior Academic Research Technology Specialist, IT Services, University of Oxford). TEI specialist for <em>Livingstone Online</em> and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] on XSLT to display the legacy transcriptions.</p>

<p>In the initial stages of site development, UCLA Digital Library staff sought to distinguish and define the digital assets to be added to both the Drupal front end and Fedora back end of the new <em>Livingstone Online</em> site. With a rough enumeration complete, the team then turned to planning the development and implementation of the site. Site development consisted of four stages: initial work done on individual developer machines, the transfer and testing of code on a "dev" site available only to UCLA staff, then on to "stage" where the LEAP project team first began to review completed work, and, finally, to "production," i.e. the public version of the website.</p>

<p>In early 2015, Wisnicki and Davison set target dates of mid spring for the internal alpha release of the site and early summer for the public beta site release. A final shift in workflow accompanied this last phase of development. To enable UCLA to work to its strength of back-end development, [qtip: Kathy Chavez|Kathy Chavez (Web Developer, KappaLuppa, Inc.). Web developer for LEAP.] of KappaLuppa, Inc. joined the project team to collaborate directly with Wisnicki on refinement of the Drupal interface, while UCLA set out an internal project plan to ensure the timely delivery of the alpha release....</p>

<p>LEAP brought together a project team of over 20 individuals, an advisory board, institutional contacts, and the representatives of an array of international collaborating institutions. In the overall workplan, the project team front-loaded site development into the first year and a half of the grant. The project took up a vast amounts of both legacy and new image and transcription data and metadata and, moreover, involved an overhaul top-to-bottom of everything related to <em>Livingstone Online</em>.</p>

<p>As one might anticipate (and as the project team did anticipate), such a scale, such an agenda, and such ambitions could not be engaged without challenges. The greatest challenges to project development emerged in three different areas: planning, data management, and time commitment.</p>

<h4><span style="font-family:crimson text;"><strong>1. Guiding the Project</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Appropriate project planning and management of multiple individuals from multiple institutions who were integrating data from multiple sources proved to be the single most difficult element in the overall development of LEAP. The project team was LEAP\'s greatest strength. The size of this international team and its exceptional commitment to <em>Livingstone Online</em> – very often on a voluntary or part-voluntary basis – enabled the work to move forward at an exceptional scale and speed, but also required diligent management of all the various responsibilities and interactions.</p>

<p>However, those very strengths also posed challenges, as the distribution of interdependent tasks across many individuals, institutions, and time zones could result in bottlenecks with formidable knock-on effects. The key lessons learned in this aspect of the project were 1) to allow for appropriate and indeed substantial management reserve in the program plan and 2) to build in regular, short-term progress checks.</p>

<p><a name="lph2.8"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">2. All That Data</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The LEAP team took up the formidable task of managing data produced over a ten-year period, during which time digital library and digital humanities "best practices" themselves continued to evolve. The <em>Livingstone Online</em> data derived from a dizzyingly complex set of sources, had been produced to diverse sets of standards (including file naming standards), and ranged between one and three terabytes of information at any one time. Dealing with this data, particularly on a day-to-day basis, proved to be the second most challenging aspect of LEAP.</p>

<p>This aspect of LEAP also resulted in a number of important lessons. The team learned that data management plans should be implemented incrementally in test phases in order to ensure continuous quality control. The team also discovered that substantial resources and time should be allocated in the budget and schedule for dedicated data management, more even than anticipated in a worst case scenario. For example, Wisnicki and Kumari\'s work on data review took three times as long as initially anticipated, and Wisnicki ultimately had to purchase and maintain his own five terabyte server after the team exceeded the storage limits of the UNL Spacely server.</p>

<p>The time commitment for LEAP overall and on a week-to-week basis also proved to be much larger than ever anticipated while writing the grant and planning the project. Though LEAP team members – paid and volunteer – worked diligently, the scope of the project proved even bigger than initially conceived and required a constant battle against scope creep.</p>

<p>As a result, the team discovered that for future projects ongoing reviews of all activities to ensure insight into schedule and resource impacts would be essential. Moreover, it became apparent that complex aspects of development would be better tackled through a series of sequential grant efforts that enabled the team to "breathe" between phases, a somewhat scaled down approach (particularly in terms of personnel) might not be amiss, and, indeed, such downsizing could be turned to advantage by creating more funding to cover more realistically the time of any given team member.</p>

<p><em>Director\'s note:</em> In August 2017, we will release the final installment of this LEAP history, which will include narratives of a) the project\'s alpha and beta launches, b) the transition of <em>Livingstone Online</em> from the UCLA Digital Library to the University of Maryland Libraries, and c) development of the formal first edition of <em>Livingstone Online</em>. The final installment will also set out additional lessons learned through the project.

<p>Field Diary XIV starts in late 1871 in Ujiji, where Livingstone has returned after failing to sail down the Lualaba River in central Congo and having witnessed a significant massacre led by slave traders in the village of Nyangwe. Starting from Ujiji, Livingstone circumnavigates Lake Tanganyika, determines that the Rusizi River flows into the lake (and so proves that the lake from its northern end cannot be a direct feeder of the Nile), returns to Ujiji, then travels east to Unyanyembe, where he rests for several months before leaving at the end of the summer to travel west yet again to the regions south of the lake.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">At the Mouth of the Rusizi, Lake Tanganyika. Illustration from Review of Henry M. Stanley\'s <em>How I Found Livingstone</em> (Anon. 1872:485), detail. <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/scotland/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Share-alike 2.5 UK: Scotland</a></em>. Stanley, who is pictured here alongside Livingstone, was the only European whom Livingstone encountered during the seven years of his final travels.</span></p>

<p>The most notable development in Field Diary XIV&nbsp;– when compared to previous diaries&nbsp;– is the presence of Henry Morton Stanley, author of the famous (and possibly apocryphal) phrase, "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" Stanley had been dispatched by <em>The New York Herald</em> to central Africa to "find" Livingstone whose letters had not reached the outside world for many months. Livngstone and Stanley\'s meeting occurred before the beginning of this diary (the exact date is <a href="/spectral-imaging/date-livingstone-stanley-meeting">in dispute</a>), and Livingstone first records Stanley\'s presence simply by noting "Mr Stanley severe fever" (1871n:[10]).</p>

<p>When Stanley, Livingstone, and their porters reach Unyanyembe on 18 February 1872, they find a cache of supplies waiting for them, including boxes that Stanley left before venturing west to find Livingstone, as well as a box that Livingstone himself left when he began his last journey. This box contains the 800-page record known as the <a href="/his-own-words/unyanyembe-journal-overview">Unyanyembe Journal</a>. Stanley has brought supplies such as copper wire, medicine, tools, and a tent for Livingstone, as well as letters and newspapers. Livingstone is also pleased to find the box he had left four years earlier; his guns, bullets, china are intact and - though the box had been waiting for four years - he can still note with relief, "cheese good" (Livingstone 1871n:[44]).</p>

<p>On 14 March 1872, Stanley leaves Unyanyembe for the coast, and Livingstone sends with him the <a href="/his-own-words/unyanyembe-journal-overview">Unyanyembe Journal</a>, "sealed with 5 seals American gold coin - anna &amp; ½ &amp; cake of paint with royal arms - Positively not to be opened" (Livingstone 1871n:[47]). Five days later and suffering from the loneliness of saying good-bye to Stanley, Livingstone recommits himself to his quest: "My Jesus, my King, my life, my all = I again dedicate my whole self to thee = accept me and grant O Gracious Father that ere this year is gone I may finish my task" (Livingstone 1871n:[48]).</p>

<p>As a result of his contact with Stanley, Livingstone engages in a new level of communication with Europe and America. While in Unyanyembe, Livingstone receives rolls of letters, newspapers, as well as books written by explorers Samuel Baker and Edward Young. More than in previous diaries, then, we see Livingstone pondering and responding to western political and scientific communities alongside his ongoing observations about local politics, geography, and environment. For instance, Livingstone writes a two-column article for <em>The New York Herald</em> tries to "enlist American Zeal to stop East Coast slave trade" (Livingstone 1871n:[60]-[61]). He even responds in his diary to a bit of court gossip.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, Livingstone continues to record local politics, particularly a war that "rages between [chiefs] Mukamba and Warmashanya or Uarmasane" (Livingstone 1871n:[9]). This war continues for the span of the diary, almost a year, involves the Arabs, as well, and causes widespread hunger in the region. Many times Livingstone records the exchange of peace offerings and suggests the war will end soon, but accurate news is difficult to acquire. For example, Livingstone first records that his friend Ghamees Wodin Lagh was killed in the conflict but then - later that same day - concludes that he was not: "Report contradicted afterwards" (Livingstone 1871n:[63]).</p>

<p>As in previous diaries, Livingstone writes from both ends of the diary at once, though this present diary differs from previous ones in that the section written upside-down from the end does not seem to serve a distinct purpose (in previous diaries the back section usually records random notes). Perhaps due to illness, Livingstone makes fewer long entries in this diary than in others, and lists and calculations are scattered throughout rather than concentrated in the back section. Livingstone sometimes only notes the date with no information, or only records basic meteorological and geographical information with no narrative.</p>

<p>There is also less overlap between the front and back sections of the diary. The back section, for instance, contains quite a few substantial passages observing an African bird, the whydah. Livingstone observes the whydah from April 1872 through to the end of the summer, recording its nesting, mating, and baby-rearing practices, but does not mention the whydah at all in the front section of the diary.</p>

<p class="space1">Field Diary XIV is one of Livingstone\'s many brown, flip-top Lett\'s notebooks, written almost exclusively in pencil: primarily in grey, secondarily in blue, with some later additions in red. It measures 140 mm high by 89 mm wide by 14 mm thick and includes a newspaper clipping. The tile of the clipping is "Further from Dr. Livingstone" and is dated "London, Aug. 29" without a year. The clipping contains only one paragraph, and notes that Dr. Kirk writes that Livingstone is still alive in Africa and still committed to finding the source of the Nile. Even as Livingstone became more public in his work against the Arab slave trade, this article records that "the Arabs there count him as a resident" and "in the region no feeling is manifested toward him" (Livingstone 1871n:[131]).</p>

<p>As Livingstone traveled in Manyema in 1870 and 1871, he ran short of many supplies, in one instance noting that he needed "Pens = Paper letters ink" (1871f:CLXII). As a result, during this period he resorted to using improvised composition materials for both his letters and diary. This section discusses Livingstone’s methods for composing the main portion of the 1871 Field Diary (Livigstone 1871f), including his practices in using paper and ink, pre-allocating pages for certain kinds of entries, and pre-numbering page headers. The section also examines the impact of the Nyangwe massacre on these practices. The section closes with a look at the composition methods Livingstone used for the additional pages of the diary.</p>

<p>When Livingstone’s supply of iron gall ink dwindled in Nyangwe, the village in which he composed most of the 1871 Field Diary, he used local materials to concoct more ink:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">7th April 1871 made this ink with the seeds<br />
of a plant called by the Arabs Zingifure<br />
It is known in India and here is used<br />
by the Manyema to dye virambas and<br />
ornament their faces and heads (1871f:CVII)</p>

<p>As a result, the Nyangwe portion of the 1871 Field Diary contains at least three kinds of inks: iron gall ink, Zingifure ink, and, on one page (1871f:CXLVI), a mixture of the two.</p>

<p>An analysis of the ink spectra for this portion of the diary offers further insights into Livingstone’s writing practices during this period. Imaging scientist Roger L. Easton, Jr. has produced <a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/livingstone-s-composition-methods/1871FD_Ink-Spectra-PowerPoint-files-Easton.zip">graphs of the relevant ink spectra</a> by mapping the reflectance curves of select ink pixels across the spectral image set of a given folio.</p>

<p>These patterns, as explained in the following sections, provide a fascinating insight into Livingstone’s objectives and strategies in composing this section of the 1871 Field Diary.</p>

<p><a id="link4" name="link4"></a></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Entries in the 1871 Field Diary</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Livingstone appears to be consistent in the type of ink he uses for his diary entries. He writes with iron gall ink for the first five pages of the diary (1871f:CII-CVI), switches to Zingifure for 41 pages (1871f:CVII-CXLV), employs an ink that appears to combine Zingifure and iron gall for half a page (1871f:CXLVI), then continues with iron gall for most of the remaining 17½ pages (1871f:CXLVII-CLXIII).</p>

<p>The deviations from Livingstone’s ink use pattern, especially the presence of pages wholly in Zingifure ink near the end of the second copy-book, suggest that Livingstone planned out the overall structure of his copy-books and did not write all his diary pages in a continuous series. Rather, he allocated certain pages for notes and on some of these pages wrote the notes ahead of time, hence the presence of Zingifure ink in those sections of the diary where he was otherwise using iron gall (see 1871f:CLVII, CLVIII, portions of CLXII, CLXIII). Other pages he left blank for notes, but as he came to the end of the diary he ended up using them instead for diary entries in iron gall ink (1871f:CLIX, CLX, portions of CLXII).</p>

<p>These practices help account for the unusual textual configuration of 1871f:CLXII. Livingstone, it seems, designated this page for a note and initially jotted down a few observations as well as a list of supplies needed in Zingifure ink. Later when he had filled the preceding pages with entries in iron gall ink, he returned to this page and wrote across the bottom portion of the page. Next, he turned the page 90 degrees clockwise and wrote additional entries in iron gall ink over the Zingifure note already at the center of the page. Finally, he crossed out the entire central section of the page using iron gall ink. As a result, iron gall and Zingifure ink cover 1871f:CLXII in almost equal proportions, the text contains both "note" and "journal" entries, and the resulting manuscript page presents the reader with no less than four textual layers: the text of <em>The Standard</em>, the note in Zingifure, the diary entries in iron gall, and the cancellation in iron gall.</p>

<p>The above only applies to Livingstone’s use of ink in the diary entries proper. The inking of his headers (his page number succeeded by the word "Journal" or "Note") follows a different pattern. He uses iron gall for the first six headers (1871f:CII-CVI), then switches to Zingifure for the rest of the diary without exception, even on the later pages that are otherwise composed with iron gall ink or with a combination of Zingifure and iron gall. This pattern indicates that Livingstone began pre-numbering the pages of the diary at some point during its composition.</p>

<p>This configuration indicates that Livingstone may have begun pre-numbering his pages with the first page of this sequence, 1871f:CXXIII, or with any of the pages up to 1871f:CXLVI. On the latter page, the use of the combination of Zingifure and iron gall ink for the main diary entry first reveals that Livingstone is pre-numbering his pages. (The initial run of headers, 1871f:CII-CXXII, and those at the end of the diary, 1871f:CLIX-CLXIII, take a more complex, but less structured form, as discussed below). Additional study of the inks and their ink spectra may yield further information.

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">The Nyangwe Massacre, 15 July 1871</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The observations made above suggest that Livingstone only switched ink twice in the course of composing the Nyangwe Diary. The first switch, to Zingifure on 1871f:CVII, occurred for practical reasons. With his supply of iron gall dwindling, Livingstone created a viable substitute using local materials, a development he notes explicitly in the text.</p>

<p>The second switch, from Zingifure to, briefly, a combination of Zingifure and iron gall (1871f:CXLVI, first paragraph), then to iron gall alone (1871f:CXLVI, second paragraph, ff.), occurs almost imperceptibly and is made without comment. More curiously, the switch coincides with the initial account of the Nyangwe massacre, which itself represents the single longest narrative entry in the Nyangwe Diary (15 July 1871) and is the only diary entry – excepting the four-page “note for letter” (1871f:CXVI-CXIX) – that spans more than two pages.</p>

<p>In other words, this second switch in ink reveals an intimate link between text and material document, a link that is lost in any transcription of the diary not accompanied by images of the folia. It appears – at least in the eyes of the present editor – that Livingstone, as he records the opening stages of the Nyangwe massacre, realizes that he is witnessing an event of singular importance and turns to his remaining reserve of iron gall ink in order to ensure that his words are legible and remain permanently on the page.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s use of ink in the additional diary pages covered by this critical edition is much more complex, due partly to the different kinds of paper employed. In natural light, ink hue across the different folia and between these folia (1871k, 1871l, 1871m) and those under 1871f seems not to be consistent.</p>

<p>Visual examination suggests that Livingstone has covered the folia under 1871k with a variety of inks. The heterogeneous nature of the material here – including diary entries that follow directly from 1871f:CLXIII, astronomical calculations (10 Mar. to 15 July 1871), the summary of "Total Rainfall in Manyema 1870-71" (Oct. 1870 to 15 Nov. 1871), and one brief set of undated notes in pencil – also indicates that Livingstone may have written the text on these folia over a long period of time. The <a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/livingstone-s-composition-methods/1871FD_Ink-Spectra-PowerPoint-files-Easton.zip">ink spectra</a> for these folia reinforce this point.</p>

<p>A variety of spectral image processing techniques arose from our work on a multispectral critical edition of Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary. These techniques have allowed us to study the passage of the diary across space, hands, and time and, ultimately, to develop a detailed chronology of the manuscript based on the material evidence of the manuscript itself (see our six-part <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">State of the Manuscript</a>).</p>

<p>A by-product of this work is our creation of animated spectral images (ASIs). As we studied our images of the 1870 Field Diary manuscript, we soon recognized our need to highlight particular events in the life of the diary in a manner more dynamic than that possible through reference to static spectral images. This need led to the introduction of ASIs (in GIF format) as a tool for advanced manuscript study. This essay provides a brief introduction to these images and to this aspect of the project development.</p>

<p><a id="asi2" name="asi2"></a></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Background</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The work of imaging scientist Keith Knox, in the main phase of image processing (2014-16), led to our initial research into using ASIs. This research followed two trajectories.</p>

<p>First, Knox developed a series of ASIs (<a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images#link38">color_raking</a>) that explore the relationship between text and topography by peering beneath the surface of the writing on the page. These ASIs allow viewers to see features of the page that are not always visible in natural light. Generated using a custom script, each animation plays in an infinite loop, alternating between two images of each page: first, a natural light image shown in decreasing 10% increments of opacity and second, the corresponding spectral image, which has been processed to show the texture of each page.</p>

The image shows the relationship between visible page features and underlying folds and creases.</span></p>

<p>Second, Knox also created sets of PowerPoint and PDF presentations that enable users to compare stain and smear alignment between two sides of a single leaf (<a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images#link40">overlaid</a>) and that facilitate reivew of natural light and topographical images side-by-side (<a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images#link39">flipbook</a>). He then transformed the latter into looping animations and, separately, also created new animations that move through longer sequences of pages, thereby foregrounding the progression of material processes across those pages (<a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images#link41">various</a>).</p>

<p>Collectively, this work demonstrated the overall value of ASIs. Unfortunately, developing further ASIs did not fall within scope of our original NEH grant and, moreover, other processing needs also prevented further attention to ASIs during the main phase of image processing work.</p>

<p><a id="asi3" name="asi3"></a></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Prototyping Objectives</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Once that main phase ended, research assistant Ashanka Kumari, in collaboration with project director Adrian S. Wisnicki, determined to prototype an alternate technique for creating ASIs that would advance study of diverse material aspects of the manuscript and combine multiple spectral images in order to offer users a representation of material manuscript processes, such as liquid saturation or page discoloration, as they develop over time.</p>

<p>The spectral images produced for the multispectral edition of Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary illuminate a range of the manuscript’s material characteristics. These include elements of composition, manuscript handling, and environmental impact as follows:</p>

<ol class="rteindent1" style="padding-bottom:1em;">
	<li>Layering of written and printed text on the page (composition)</li>
	<li>Changes in the visual character of Livingstone’s ink (composition)</li>
	<li>Reinking of select passages in an alternate ink (composition)</li>
	<li>Manuscript folds, impressions, holes, and other damage (manuscript handling)</li>
	<li>Page discoloration and staining from multiple substances (environmental impact)</li>
</ol>

<p>Once we had identified and studied these elements, we determined to create a range of representative ASIs, each focusing on one specific material characteristic. We wanted to foreground this characteristic in a manner that would be legible to users, efficiently combine static images into a dynamic visualization, and could be easily reproduced by our project team as well as others outside the scope of our project. Above all, we wanted to bring the material history of the diary to life in an exciting manner that demonstrated the individual and combined value of our new processed spectral images.</p>

<p>Images in the Graphic Interchange Format (GIF), the format selected for our ASIs, are ubiquitous on the internet. The format has proven easy to create and share, is supported on different browsers, and plays on an infinite loop, thereby removing the need for users to iterate the animation. GIFs also have time as a vector, a feature that supports our goals of showing the evolution of the manuscript over time. Yet despite such advantages, GIFs are not ideal for high-resolution images such as ours and indeed GIFs best lend themselves to video clips rather than static photographs.</p>

<p>As a result, the initial stage of ASI development focused on identifying the software appropriate to the project needs. Kumari’s first attempts to create ASIs using online generators resulted in choppy GIFs that lacked smooth transitions between individual spectral images. As a result, she ultimately settled on <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/" target="_blank">iMovie</a>, a free Mac-based tool that allows for the addition of transitions between images and modifications in timing, and can also generate numerous files, which better supports the batch processing needs of our project.</p>

<p class="space1" style="line-height:110%"><a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/prototyping-animated-spectral-images-asis/Kumari-screen-shot-article.png"><img alt="Screen shot of Ashanka Kumari\'s computer with 1870 Field Diary images arranged in iMovie.

<p>With the software selected, Kumari, in consultation with Wisnicki, developed the following workflow for creating the ASIs:</p>

<ol class="rteindent1">
	<li>Select a manuscript page and/or feature of interest for animated study.</li>
	<li>Review available spectral images available for the given page and choose images (ideally, three to five images) that best enhance the manuscript element selected.</li>
	<li>Experiment with image arrangement to determine best sequence of images for animation.</li>
	<li>Input images in order followed by images in reverse order into iMovie, add transitions, and set timing of transitions and image display.</li>
	<li>Export images as an MP4 file.</li>
	<li>Open the MP4 file with iMovie and alter the speed of the MP4 file as needed.</li>
	<li>Use an online MP4 to GIF converter to create the final product (required because MP4s don’t play on an infinite loop like GIFs do).</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, this workflow enables us to exert considerable control over the final product and to experiment with different image and speed permutations. The biggest disadvantages of the process are, first, the need to convert MP4s to GIF and, second, the amount of time needed to export the MP4s, especially when we include images with larger file sizes.</p>

<p>Knox laid the groundwork for our development of ASIs by creating animations that linked text and topography of individual manuscript pages (forthcoming in January 2017) and by producing PowerPoint and PDF presentations that allowed for comparative study of features such as staining, smearing, and page surface:</p>

<p>Kumari also created additional sets of ASIs that focus on two specific pages of the manuscript, each of which combine a range of features of interest, including layered text and staining:</p>

<p><strong><u>Bonus:</u> </strong>Download all the ASIs of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary developed by Kumari in a <a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/prototyping-animated-spectral-images-asis/Animated-Spectral-Images-(ASIs)-Complete.zip">single ZIP file</a> (685.9 MB).</p>

<p>The presentations and initial animations set the stage for creating the ASIs, which, in turn, are able to foreground manuscript feature(s) of interest while relying on only a handful of original static images. The ASIs also demonstrate the importance of the original spectral images – both individually and in combination – in highlighting the given feature. Finally, because of duration, the ASIs help underscore the role of change over time in producing the given feature.</p>

<p>As a result, the presentations, animations, and ASIs together realized and even exceeded all objectives for this aspect of project development. Additionally, the process for producing the ASIs developed by Kumari is straightforward and, although potentially time consuming, can be replicated in the future to illuminate additional features of the 1870 Field Diary manuscript, as well as other manuscripts enhanced with spectral imaging.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> presents Livingstone’s legacy in all its complexity. We celebrate Livingstone’s vision of human equality, which distinguished him among contemporary Victorian travelers to Africa. We recognize the value of his writings in illuminating African history and culture, European imperialism, and the nineteenth-century slave trade. We also acknowledge postcolonial critiques of Livingstone’s works and of the imperial project as a whole, and so strive not to perpetuate Victorian imperial stereotypes of the non-Western world.</p>

<p>Yet overall the directors of <em>Livingstone Online</em> take inspiration from Livingstone’s idealism to guide the development of our site. We also feel gratitude for the personal support that has been directed towards our work and for the many long-term professional relationships that our work has engendered. As a result, we strive to carry out our research according to what might be termed the <em>Livingstone Online</em> code. This code serves as one of the most important facets in our efforts to develop a publicly-oriented digital project. At the core of this code reside five elements:</p>

<p><a id="loc2" name="loc2"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Cross-cultural awareness</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> is an international project. Our leadership currently resides in the US and the UK, while our collaborators come from both countries as well as South Africa and other parts of the world. The distributed nature of our project offers an immense advantage to our research practices, but also means that we must be responsible for the two-way flow of knowledge, for giving to those places from which we take.</p>

<p>For instance, in drafting our grant applications, we ensure that we can meet with collaborators and representatives of partner institutions face to face. Such meetings play a key role in strengthening our working relationships, but also enable us to gain firsthand feedback and ensure that all stakeholders have a genuine stake in our project. We have also created an <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-outreach-program">outreach program</a> that, we hope, will enable those communities that have been most supportive of our work to engage with and indeed benefit from the resources available on <em>Livingstone Online</em>.</p>

<p>On our website, we strive to be attentive in presenting information in order not to replicate the Victorian prejudices inherent in Livingstone’s works and those of other Victorian-era writers. We try to formulate our discussions of non-Western peoples in an informed manner, we take account of corrective modern scholarship, and we recognize that even seemingly neutral words like “discovery” and “natives” – words that continue to be bandied about in popular discussions of Livingstone’s legacy – have a history and can misrepresent both nineteenth-century and contemporary realities.</p>

<p><a id="loc3" name="loc3"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Responsible conduct towards project partners</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>More than one hundred archives and individuals around the world hold original David Livingstone manuscript items. To date, <em>Livingstone Online</em> has partnered with nearly half this number to publish high quality images and/or rigorous transcriptions of these items.</p>

<p>In some cases, our staff has collaborated closely with partners to ensure that our digital facsimiles meet institutional requirements and needs. In other cases, institutions and individuals have given us unfettered permission to publish images and/or transcription, or allowed our users to reuse these images under some form of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a>.</p>

<p>In return institutions and individuals often ask for little more than acknowledgment and our word that we will adhere to our agreements with them. Our partnerships, therefore, rely on a high degree of trust. We consider such commitment to our site an honor and privilege, and, as a result, make a significant effort to&nbsp;ensure that we meet the terms of all agreements and that our use of primary materials repays and indeed justifies the trust put in us.</p>

<p>The directors of the <em>Livingstone Online</em> have drawn on the work of some sixty individuals with relevant professional skills, thanks to the three phases of <em>Livingstone Online</em> development (2005-09, 2010-12, 2013-present) and the three stages of the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em> (2009-10, 2010-12, 2013-present).</p>

<p>These individuals come from a variety of fields such as literature, history, library science, computer programming, imaging science, law, data management, and program management. In some cases, we have been fortunate to support the work of these individuals with funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the British Academy, the Wellcome Trust, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>However, rarely has funding matched effort expended. Indeed much of our support has come pro bono, motivated mainly by goodwill or a shared belief in the goals of our project. We are very attentive to the nature of this support and grateful for it. Throughout the site, indeed wherever possible, we strive to recognize the contributions of our collaborators by citations, text, images, and other forms of public acknowledgment.</p>

<p>We take pride in being a public project, by which we mean a project that is publicly funded and that recognizes the importance of being publicly accountable – particularly as some of our leading partner institutions include public universities such as the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>We seek to make all aspects of our work uniformly transparent to the fullest extent possible. We hope that our emphasis on transparency will enable funders to support our work with confidence and will allow users to learn about our work in depth, in the best spirit of knowledge transfer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We provide extensive documentation – which we consider the foundation of responsible scholarship and science – for all aspects of our project. This documentation includes detailed project histories, numerous images of the project team at work, and a broad array of <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-project-documents">downloadable project documents</a> created in the course of our research. Indeed, we take pride in the fact that we allow users to look behind the scenes of our work in a manner equaled by few other digital projects.</p>

<p>It is never lost on us that we are conducting advanced digital research at a time when public funding for the humanities is diminishing drastically. As a result, we work to ensure the responsible expenditure of our funding. In particular, this commitment has infused our development of the <em>Livingstone Online</em> website.</p>

<p>We have adhered to industry best practices in building our site and have created our core data to reflect international archival standards. We are also working on integrating the site into the University of Maryland Libraries to capitalize of their robust system of data management and backup, and to ensure that the site is maintained long term as part of their overall digital collection. In the future, we also plan to mirror the site in the UK in order to help preserve our data.</p>

<p>All of our data is freely available to the public and, wherever possible, released under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> so that it can be reused in a broad variety of educational contexts. Users can access our data both as mediated by our site or, should they prefer, as flat image, transcription, and metadata files that can readily be incorporated into other digital projects. We have also designed our site carefully so that it caters to modern internet sensibilities and so that it promotes not just access but sustained use of all our materials.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) gets its name from the town of Unyanyembe, in present-day Tanzania. In this journal (UJ for short), Livingstone records highlights of his final trip to Africa, from 1865 until 1872. Often he copies these highlights over, in revised and/or expanded form, from his <a href="/his-own-words/final-field-diaries-general-overview">field diaries</a>. The Unyanyembe Journal is the record upon which Horace Waller based the posthumously-published <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874; also see Helly 1987). In it, Livingstone records his journey from Bombay to Zanzibar, up the river Rovuma to Lake N’Yassa and then north to Lake Tanganyika. From there, he travels west to Lake Moero and, from there, south to Lake Bangweolo. At this point, he makes his way back to Lake Tanganyika, travelling up the eastern shore and making a detour to the Taboro region and leaving the journal in the town of Unyanyembe.</p>

<p>From that point of Livingstone\'s departure from Unyanyembe, the entries in the journal are created after the fact, based on the field diaries that he keeps as he journeys west to Bambarre and Nyangwe. He retrieves the journal in 1871, creating these after-the-fact entries and copying letters into it while also adding new material until he sends the journal back to England with Henry M. Stanley in 1872.</p>

<p>As he rewrites his field diary entries into the journal, Livingstone documents his further travels from Unyanyembe to Ujiji, then across Lake Tanganyika and west to region of Manyema (which includes the villages of Bambarre and Nyangwe). From there, he retraces his steps back to Ujiji, where he first meets Henry Morton Stanley and eventually entrusts the UJ to him.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey, Livingstone relies on help from the porters he has brought with him, as well as additional guides and porters hired as he goes. The UJ records information about the Arab slave trade; religious observations and missionary work; ecological, geological, medical, and technological information; observations about eastern and central African cultures; exploration and geography; and British and local politics.</p>

<p>The UJ differs from Livingstone’s field diaries in that it primarily functions as a record of important information rather than on-the-fly notations. Livingstone copies key documents and data into it, as well as the day-to-day experiences he determines are worth preserving. Its final form is much more like a book than a journal, including the index he creates at the end. The last several hundred pages contain many copies of important letters. Throughout there are rainfall and altitude tables, drawings, vocabulary charts, supply requests, and lists (e.g., 1866-72:[287], “Fishes of Liemba”).</p>

<p>In this, the UJ constitutes what Roy Bridges labels a “second stage” document, one that “omitted, amended or expanded the material in the notebooks” (1977:4). The UJ is clearly a work in progress, however, as Livingstone sometimes introduces notes to himself or future editors, as when he amends a note, “(2nd April left very ill with dysentery – This is private)” (1866-72:[272]). Moreover, evidence suggests that Livingstone adds at least some such notes long after the fact, reinforcing his focus on future publication.</p>

<p>Among the UJ’s most consistent concerns is slavery: its facts and effects as well as Livingstone’s philosophical and ethical objections. The journal starts with a description of the Zanzibar slave market, which drives the central and emerging west-central African slave trades. Livingstone’s objection to slavery is that he believes the condition of being enslaved corrupts one for life and makes people “slaves in heart,” even if they are freed (1866-72:[314]).</p>

<p>This belief troubles his relationship with his porters, many of whom are freed slaves. He divides them into groups: sepoys (Indian soldiers); Nassick boys (educated at a British school for freed slaves in Nashik, India); Johannaese or Johanna men (from the island of Johanna, i.e., present-day Anjouan in the Comoros). Though he is critical of all of them, he is most critical of the Nassick boys for having “the slave spirit pretty strongly,” which he attributes to race: “it goes deepest in those who have the darkest skins” (1866-72:[43]).</p>

<p>Livingstone devotes the end of his career to two goals: finding the source of the Nile and drawing attention to the role Great Britain plays in the African slave trade. In a letter to the Earl of Granville, he writes, “The subject to which I beg to draw your attention is the part which the Banians of Zanzibar who are protected British subjects play in carrying on the slave trade in Central Africa and especially in the Manyuema - The country West of Ujiji” (1866-72:[737]). Livingstone argues that because the Banians are British subjects, ending the Zanzibar-based slave trade does not constitute interfering with another nation’s sovereignty. The UJ contains several copied letters in which he exhorts British officials to undertakes this plan in opposition to the idea of slowly “civilizing” the slave trade out of Africa: “there is a sort of charm in the prospect of gradual amelioration of the state of slavery by the steady advance of trade and civilization yet all experience proves the prospect to be delusive” (1866-72:[137]).</p>

<p>Livingstone’s ideas about race, slavery, and capitalism intersect with his Christian mission, though that intersection is not always straightforward. At certain points he makes clear connections between religious observation and Christianity, on one hand, and the development of European-style culture, on the other. For instance, he complains that “There is nothing interesting in a heathen town” because its inhabitants spend all their time laboring to raise and process food (1866-72:[291]). He also labels Arab and African religions as “superstitions” and argues that we can see the progress of civilization as one of superstition to religion. Demonstrating his belief in progressive development, he adds that even European civilizations show “a remnant of our own superstitions” (1866-72:[370]).</p>

<p>Elsewhere, however, Livingstone questions these mainstream Victorian beliefs, discussing religious practices with the Arab trader Muhmmad Bogarib and noting that “These Arabs seem very religious in their way” (1866-72:[314]). Livingstone also bemoans the unchristian greed that commerce brings by decoupling Christianity and industrial civilization: “If this is enlargement of mind produced by commerce, commend me to the untrading African” (1866-72:[254]). Over the course of the UJ, Livingstone responds to individual situations as they arise, oscillating between belief in and interrogation of Victorian norms.</p>

<p>The UJ also contains a depth of observations about central and south-central African culture. Livingstone has a few ethnographic questions to which he returns again and again. Almost every time he encounters a new ethnic group, for instance, he records their tattoos; describes their teeth, facial features and/or body type; and speculates on the possibility that they engage in cannibalism. Evidence elsewhere suggests that the local populations in Manyema actually pretended to be cannibals as a strategy of resistance, thereby compelling Livingstone to return to this question time and again, as he writes in a letter to the Earl of Clarendon: “The Manyema are certainly cannibals but it was long ere I could get evidence more positive than would have led a Scotch jury to give a verdict of not proven - they eat only enemies killed in war” (1866-72:[568]) (For more on this topic, see Livingstone, Central Africa, 1870.) The journal also records extensive observations about local religious practices; marriage, sexual practices, and childbirth; technologies (iron forging and tool building); clothing; and what Livingstone’s takes to be the temperament of each ethnic group.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Livingstone approves of the body types that he sees as being more European and often connects these bodily features to personal qualities that he finds praise-worthy, including honesty, hard work, and deference to authority (sometimes Livingstone’s perceived authority but also deference to their chief). For instance, he notes of Mapuio’s people, “many have quite the Grecian facial angle – Mapuio has thin lips &amp; quite a European Face – Delicate features and limbs are common &amp; the spur heel as scarce as among Europeans” (1866-72:[204]). Though he does not make a causal connection, he also notes of the same ethnic group, “there is a great deal of good in these poor people” – specifically that they rely on kinship structures, have signs of a solid work ethic, and show what Livingstone deems proper respect for him (1866-72:[204]).</p>

<p>Livingstone also praises non-European cultural forms in relation to how much they conform to his standards. He praises Mapuio’s people for their politeness, communicability, and tendency to separate gender roles; they “have their distinctive tribal tattoo – the women indulge in this painful luxury more than the men probably because they have very few ornaments” (1866-72:[204]). He also records that they use hand clapping to show respect, logging some phrases that can be communicated through clapping: “‘allow me’ – ‘I beg pardon’ – ‘Permit me to pass’ – ‘Thanks’” etc (1866-72:[205]).</p>

<p>To Livingstone, these are all signs of a civilized culture; though the expressions differ from European modes of ornament or communication, he sees them as evidence of European values. Livingstone’s interest in authority also shows up as descriptions of many of the chiefs he encounters, though no one garners so much attention as Cazembe, who resides between Lakes Moero and Bangweolo. His violent, autocratic leadership style first garners Livingstone’s censure, but later Livingstone modifies this assessment and concludes that “Cazembe is good but his people are bad” (1866-72:[434]). Livingstone’s own values and experiences thus permeate his record of what he sees around him, often in ways difficult to disentangle.</p>

<p>Trained as a doctor, Livingstone records a significant amount of medical data, including reports of small pox; descriptions of safura or clay eating (what we would now call pica); irritable skin ulcers; syphilis; and malaria. Because his medicines are stolen early in the journey, he often reports on Arab, African, or Portuguese remedies. He also notes many other scientific observations, especially ecological information. He keeps scrupulous rainfall charts, and writes detailed observations of the local plants and growing conditions. He also muses on the relationship between colonialism and animal life: “In other so called new countries a wave of English weeds follows the tide of English Emigration - and so with insects” (1866-72:[81]). Livingstone’s tone varies between descriptions for their own sake and pondering European life in Africa – for instance, by describing geological formations and food cultivation methods at certain points, while at others pointing out the potential presence of coal or lauding the under-used fertility of the soil.</p>

<p>From the beginning of his last journey, Livingstone commits himself to the discovery of the source of the Nile, seeing this as his lasting contribution to geographical knowledge. Unfortunately, he also becomes progressively more convinced that Ptolemy’s theory of the four fountains is correct: “From their bases I found that the springs of the Nile do unquestionably arise - this is just what Ptolemy put down &amp; is true geography” (1866-72:[563]). This erroneous idea, coupled with some incorrect geographical calculations, lead Livingstone to pursue this false idea until his death (see “Livingstone’s Global Sources”).</p>

<p>He also becomes more and more embroiled in arguments with the Royal Geographical Society and John Kirk, British political agent at Zanzibar, over money, goods, and porters. Several times, he copies over his requests for more supplies and his justification for these requests. “Let me explain but in no boastful style the mistakes of others who have bravely striven to solve the ancient problem,” he writes in a letter to the Earl of Clarendon in 1871, “and it will be seen that I have cogent reasons for following the painful plodding investigation to its conclusion” (1866-72:[565]).</p>

<p>Though Livingstone lives through and records significant local conflicts, he never ceases to write to a British audience, filtering his experiences through the lens of an eventual British audience. For instance, when his carriers threaten mutiny he dismisses it as “one of the troubles of travelling” (1866-72:[87]). Likewise, when they face starvation, he justifies the days spent recording that: “We all feel weak &amp; easily tired &amp; an incessant hunger teases us, so it is no wonder though so large a space of this paper is occupied by stomach affairs” (1866-72:[252]).</p>

<p>At the same time, the journal contains information that modifies some of the myths later propagated about Livingstone’s last journey, especially in relation to his porters. After James Chuma and Abdullah Susi transported Livingstone’s body and manuscripts from central Africa to Britain, they were lauded as Livingstone’s faithful servants. The UJ, however, records a more autocratic relationship, including an incident when Livingstone, eager to march and finding resistance among his men, “fired a pistol at [Susi] but missed - there being no law nor magistrate higher than myself I would not be thwarted if I could help it” (1866-72:[377]).</p>

<p>These difficulties form a consistent thread throughout the UJ. Livingstone spends months in 1867, for instance, stuck with Hamees’ people south of Lake Tanganyika while he waits to see how a conflict between the Nsama (alternately, Insama) people and the Arabs plays out. This dictates the route he will take and who will go with him (see 1866-27:[342] for a single narrative account). His men mutiny over the course of 1870-1 and as a result, he cannot hire canoes or guides. He travels with Arab slave traders and between their bad reputation and his own, he is constantly stymied in his travels and often in open conflict with locals. Often, local events collide with outside politics, as when a horrific massacre in 1871 at Nyangwe by Arab traders combine with new porters of whom he does not approve (1866-72:[698]; cf. our edition of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary).</p>

<p>Overall, the UJ combines Livingstone’s daily observations and events with his attempts to see these events as a whole and present them for a British audience. His rationale for this journey emerges as a combination of personal ambition, moral reasoning, and a nationalist civic duty. When asked why he is there, he tells a Babsia traveller:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">I wished to make country and people better known to the rest of the world - We were all children of one father and I was anxious that we should know each other better and that friendly visits should be made in safety - Told him what the queen [Victoria] had done to encourage the growth of cotton on the Zambezi and how we had been thwarted by slave traders and their abettors - they were pleased with this. (1866-72:[447])</p>

<p>As this shows, Livingstone’s core beliefs in Christianity, monarchy, and development drove his presence in Africa, where he believed himself to be aiding the people of Africa through greater publicity. The controversies and conflicting loyalties that he records in the Unyanyembe Journal do not substantially alter his belief. Though he spent most of his adult life living in Africa, Livingstone clung fiercely to his identity as a British subject, as this – the most comprehensive and polished manuscript from his last journey – attests.</p>

Examples of simple manipulation include retouching, color correction, noise reduction, and changing image contrast. Processing techniques can also take a variety of complex forms. In the case of palimpsests, for instance, imaging scientists can create an algorithm to peel back the prominent "overtext" (the uppermost layer of text) in order to reveal the "undertext" (the underlying text), which is often much more difficult, if not impossible, to read.</p>

<p>The processing of Livingstone’s letter&nbsp;involved a high degree of collaboration between project director Adrian S. Wisnicki and the imaging scientists. After the letter was imaged, Wisnicki reviewed the images of each leaf and marked several regions of interests (ROIs). He then submitted the marked-up images to the imaging team alongside a set of questions to inform potential processing. The questions related to textual issues, such as bleedthrough and illegible handwriting, as well as physical qualities (water stains, wax residue, paper creases).</p>

<p>In response, the imaging scientists used several techniques to enhance the images of the letter, from applying the standard pseudocolor processing to the raking images, to using a more complex multiband method that sought to separate out the different texts, stains, etc. The <a href="/islandora/search?f%255B%255D=repository_ms%3A&quot;Peter%2BBeard%2BStudio&quot;&amp;view_pid=liv%3A002564&amp;view_page=0">processed images</a> included in this edition demonstrate some of the possibilities for enhancing text, topography, and other material features of Livingstone\'s letter <em>and</em> for highlighting the relationship of these three elements. Alongside such processing, the team also evaluated the raw spectral images of the letter and provided a series of imaging recommendations to guide future work on Livingstone’s manuscripts.</p>

To create a "pseudocolor" image, two images are locally adjusted in brightness and contrast over a sliding window (about three text lines high) to make the images uniform in appearance. The two images are then combined into one color image by putting one image in the red separation and the other image into the green and blue separations. Where the two images are of comparable value, the pseudocolor image appears neutral, i.e. without color, or black and white. Where the two images are different, the pseudocolor image appears red or cyan, depending on which image is brighter.

<p>For many years, scholars have debated the precise date of the celebrated meeting between David Livingstone and Henry M. Stanley in Ujiji 1871. Both travellers lost track of the date due to illness, as indeed explorers often did. As a result, Stanley gives the dates as 3 November or 10 November (depending on the text), while the only dating from Livingstone – ambiguous at best – points to 28 October. The 1871 Field Diary does not resolve the issue, but it does provide crucial evidence for further analysis.</p>

<p>Scholars have already made several attempts to pinpoint the date of the meeting. Much of this work depends on a note from Livingstone in the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72). In the Journal, Livingstone records that he realized at the beginning of Ramadan (14 Nov. 1871) that he had incorrectly dated his diary. Livingstone indicates that he deduced from Stanley\'s almanac that he, Livingstone, had run ahead by 21 days. So, for instance, when Livingstone wrote 23 October 1871 in his Field Diary (the day he arrived at Ujiji), it was actually 2 October.</p>

Stanley. The date 28 October 1871 appears in the margin and suggests that Livingstone believed the meeting happened on this date. The entry itself is continuous from the previous page, 24 October 1871. Stanley\'s middle name is given as \'Moreland\' rather than \'Morton.\'</span></p>

<p>Cunningham (1985) uses this information to advance one of the most rigorous assessments of the situation. He concludes that Livingstone is only 20 days out and that the actual date should be fixed as 27 October 1871, not the 28 October as Livingstone\'s diary suggests (Cunningham 1985:37). Cunningham observes that in the final fragment of the 1871 Field Diary (Livingstone 1871m:[3]), Livingstone writes that 1 November and 3 November were, respectively, Thursday and Saturday (Cunningham 1985:37). Although Livingstone may have been mistaken about the date, the Arabs with whom he travelled would still have known the day of the week, due to the need to observe Jumu\'ah prayers.</p>

<p>If this hypothesis is correct, Cunningham argues, then 1 and 3 November are in fact 12 and 14 October, and so Livingstone is 20 days out. Although the evidence of the 1871 Field Diary does support such a reading, as described below, the key issue with Cunningham\'s argument lies in his numerical correction. If Livingstone was ahead by 20, not 21, days, then a day needs to be added – not subtracted – from 28 October, giving us 29 October 1871 as the day of the meeting.</p>

<p>Roy C. Bridges, in response to Cunningham, argues for 29 October 1871. Bridges also observes that it is possible to trace the 20 day error as far back as the beginning of 1871. On 16 January (1871a:LXXVI [v.1]), Livingstone records that "Ramadan ended last night." Since Ramadan ended in 1870 on 24 December, Livingstone\'s comment indicates that he was at this stage 22 days ahead.</p>

<p>Bridges also sheds light on the confusion of Livingstone\'s dating by discussing later entries from June and July 1871 (Bridges 1982). In the Unyanyembe Journal, notes Bridges, Livingstone writes that new Arab months began on 11 June and 10 July. Livingstone, adds Bridges, is mistaken about which Arab month it is in each case – in both instances Livingstone is three months ahead because he is counting from the end of the last Ramadan not from the beginning of the Islamic year. Once it becomes clear Livingstone counts Islamic months in this way, the evidence of the Journal does indeed suggest a 20-21 day margin or error, thereby confirming Livingstone\'s own statement.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Evidence from the 1871 Field Diary</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>In the 1871 Field Diary, the 11 June and 10 July entries correspond to the Unyanyembe Journal and so confirm that Livingstone was about 20 to 21 days out during these two months. Another passage from 3 April in the 1871 Field Diary, however, helps fill out the picture. This passage shows that in April, Livingstone was 21 – not 20 – days out. The passage also confirms Bridges\'s suggestion that Livingstone was three months off in identifying the Arab month.</p>

<p>In the entry, Livingstone writes, "This morning 4th of avil time […]" (1871f:CVI). On first reading, contextual evidence suggests that Livingstone has made a mistake and written "avil" instead of "April." The entry follows the beginning of the 3 April 1871 entry and precedes the 5 April 1871 entry. There is also no separate reference to 4 April 1871. Horace Waller – who used C.A. Alington\'s transcription of this passage (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript">The Manuscript</a>) – proceeds on this basis and gives this as the opening of the 4 April 1871 entry in the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874).</p>

The phrase \'4th of avil time\' appears in the third line here.</span></p>

<p>However, there is reason not to accept this reading. Livingstone concludes the entry in which the passage appears with an additional statement: "3rd Arab month 4th will appear in two or three days" (Livingstone 1871f:CVI). An entry made a week later confirms the details of the previous statement: "12 April 1871 New [moon] last night of 4th Arab month" (Livingstone 1871f:CIX).</p>

<p>The concluding statement on 1871f:CVI merits attention for two reasons. First, spectral imaging reveals that this statement has been written in Zingifure ink, while the rest of the page is in iron gall ink. This suggests that Livingstone added the statement at a later date, as, in fact, 1871f:CVI is the last page Livingstone wrote in iron gall ink until 1871f:CXLVI (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript-composition">Manuscript Composition</a>).</p>

The processed image highlights the use of Zingifure ink, which appears blue while the surrounding text is closer to black.</span></p>

<p>Second, given these points, it is reasonable to suppose that the after-the-fact addition, which Livingstone took the trouble to make, has reference to the context in which it was made. In other words, in this reading, one possibility is that "4th" in the Zingifure ink addition refers to the prior "4th of avil time" passage, <em>and is a correction of it</em>.</p>

<p>If so, then the "avil" of the latter passage might also be read – not as "April" – but as Livingstone\'s transliteration of "awwal," or, more fully, "Shahr Al-awwal," an Arabic phrase that means first month of the lunar year. Livingstone\'s use of this phrase suggests that "avil time" is his way of referring to the Islamic calendar as a whole and so that he initially meant that it was the fourth Arab month, then corrected it to the third.</p>

<p>The first day of the fourth Arab month (Rabi II) in 1871 was 20 June. In other words, when Livingstone wrote 12 April 1871 in his Field Diary and stated that it was the fourth Arab month, the date was in fact 20 June 1871. He was behind in his dates by no less than 69 days! Obviously something is amiss if the text is interpreted in this way. The error is easily rectified if we follow Bridges\'s suggestion, noted earlier, that Livingstone was counting the months from the last Ramadan rather than from the beginning of the Islamic year (Bridges 1982).</p>

<p>The fourth Arab month on this reading would be the fourth since Ramadan, but the first of the Islamic year, which brings us back to Livingstone\'s "avil." The first day of the first Arab month (Muharram) in 1871 fell on 23 March. The difference between 23 March and 12 April is 20 days. This calculation in turn supports Cunningham\'s argument that Livingstone is 20 days out. Yet the matter is not quite put to rest. By this same calculation, 11 June and 10 July (the two other dates in the 1871 Field Diary and 1872 Journal on which Livingstone records the appearance of a new moon) are, respectively, 21 and 20 days out. Over the three months a slight fluctuation appears, but this can be accounted for by the fact that new moons at times go unspotted until one or two days after their first phase.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, one problem remains. If, based on Livingstone\'s records, 28 or 29 October seem the likeliest dates, how can this be reconciled with Stanley\'s accounts? The most contemporary evidence from Stanley comes from a despatch he sent to <em>The New York Herald</em> dated 10 November 1871. In this despatch, Stanley (1970:59) writes that the meeting took place a week earlier, on the 3 November 1871. Yet in <em>How I Found Livingstone</em>, Stanley (1872:274-75) notes that he also lost track of the date and, like Livingstone, did not realize the error until the coming of Ramadan. In his case, adds Stanley, he was seven days ahead. However, the text itself of <em>How I Found Livingstone</em> gives the date as 10 November (Stanley 1872:405), a point that implicitly suggests that Stanley was behind – not ahead – seven days.</p>

<p>The situation is confusing indeed. François Bontinck (1979) infers that when Stanley wrote 3 November, he had not yet corrected his dates. If he had, he would have written 27 October, a date that agrees with Cunningham. Yet as we have seen, this date does not agree with the surviving evidence from Livingstone himself. Bontinck also explains that the reason why Stanley gives the date of the meeting as 10 November is that he mistakenly added seven days to his record of 3 November instead of subtracting them, and so this problem, for Bontinck at least, is resolved.</p>

<p>The final turn in the critical argument comes from Tim Jeal. In his recent biography of Stanley, Jeal (2007:505) contends that the 3 November date is <em>already</em> the product of a subtraction. Jeal notes that in an earlier diary, Stanley had given the date of the meeting as 10 November. The date in the despatch, 3 November, was thus seven days earlier and, it appears, had already been revised by Stanley. Yet, if this reasoning is correct, the date of Stanley\'s despatch becomes dubious. The despatch records the meeting with Livingstone and so must have been written after 14 November when the two men together realized their mistakes in dating. Other evidence presented by Jeal, which is too detailed to recount here, again contradicts the 3 November date in favour of the 10 November date.</p>

<p>Whatever the case here, Jeal (2007:505-06) ultimately suggests that the details recorded by Stanley are inconsequential and that Stanley fabricated the fact that he had made a mistake in the first place! When Stanley realized that Livingstone believed the meeting to have taken place in late October, Stanley invented the story of his mistake in order to minimize the discrepancy between the two accounts and to make it appear that his, Stanley\'s, date was closer to Livingstone\'s than it really was. When it came to writing <em>How I Found Livingstone</em> – the permanent record of the encounter – Stanley opted for what he really believed to be the real date, 10 November 1871. Jeal (2007:506) also adds that Livingstone\'s "21-day discrepancy is by no means a proven quantity."</p>

<p>In other words, the historical and critical record gives us the possible dates of 27, 28, 29 October, and 3 and 10 November for the Livingstone and Stanley meeting. Moreover, although the 1871 Field Diary confirms the text of the Unyanyembe Journal, namely that Livingstone was some 20 or 21 days out in his dating, we can go no further than this because we don\'t really have a date for the meeting itself from Livingstone.</p>

<p>In the Journal, Livingstone begins to describe Stanley\'s arrival in the midst of a long entry marked earlier as 24 October (Livingstone 1866-72:[727]). As the entry progresses without break to the next page (1866-72:[728]), Livingstone writes the date 28 October in the margin. The text, however, is continuous from one page to the next, and there is no obvious place for the new entry to begin. In addition, as Bridges astutely notes (1982), Livingstone writes the descriptive text that sets the stage for the meeting in a rather ambiguous manner – "But when my spirits were at their lowest ebb the good Samaritan was close at hand for one morning Susi came running at the top of his speed &amp; gasped out \'An Englishman – I see him\'" (1866-72:[727]) – wording that opens possibilities rather than closes them, especially the reference to "one morning."</p>

<p>As a result, we can go no further than this, at least without the discovery of additional evidence. The 1871 Field Diary, although it advances the critical discussion, cannot close it. The last entry in the 1871 Field Diary (1871m:[3]) bears a date of 3 November, which, when corrected, gives us either 13 October (a difference of 21 days) or 14 October (20 days, Cunningham\'s argument). The Diary, therefore, brings us to the doorstep of the celebrated meeting and its actual date, but no further.</p>

<p>The practice and understanding of medicine profoundly changed during the years of Livingstone\'s life (1813-1873). These changes grew out of the massive restructuring of British society that followed the industrial revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Throughout the nineteenth century, British people moved from town to country, while the British economy and labor force moved from agriculture to industry and commerce.</p>

<p>Although in Africa for much of his adult life, Livingstone\'s letters bear testimony to these transformations, notably in so far as they affected London. When Livingstone first visited London in 1838 it was already a massive metropolis; not an industrial city but a thriving port, the centre of a rapidly expanding empire, in whose growth and administration Livingstone was to play a part.</p>

<p>But in 1838 London was full of overcrowded, unpoliced, disease-ridden slums. The "Great Wen," as it was known, might have seemed an anarchic, terrifying place (although perhaps not to someone who had studied in Glasgow). Indeed many missionary societies considered working at home, arguing that reclaiming the "savage" inhabitants of these slums for Christianity was as important as converting the "savages" of Africa or India.</p>

<p>The massive growth of towns and cities in Britain after the industrial revolution had produced terrible problems of public health. People living in overcrowded slums with insufficient and contaminated water and heaps of human and animal refuse piled around them were subject to endemic diseases such as small-pox, tuberculosis, typhoid, and dysentery, but also to murderous epidemics, especially cholera which swept through Britain in 1832, 1848, and 1854.</p>

<p>Doctors and others commonly described the disease-producing conditions of the British slum as similar to the swamps of Africa. The healthiness or otherwise of the air in both places was frequently commented on. Malarias (mal-aria) and miasmas – bad airs – were widely regarded as the cause of epidemic disease, whether they arose from decomposing vegetation in the jungle or rotting waste in the streets of St. Giles (a notoriously dirty and dangerous London parish).</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s writings are steeped in implicit and explicit comparisons of the health of British towns with Africa. When he talks of a place on the Zambesi being like a cesspit, it was possibly London or Glasgow to which he was comparing it. However, Livingstone\'s letters, which were written over a period of more than thirty years, do not all strike the same tone. His earliest letters are those of an eager young missionary who had seen the degradation and heathenism of Glasgow and London and might be said to be devoted to making individual conversions.</p>

<p>By the time of Livingstone\'s second return from Africa in 1864 the city had begun to change. The heyday of Victorian stability and prosperity had arrived. The Great Exhibition of 1851, as had been hoped, inaugurated a new era. Wealth began to flow to the middle classes and also to many working-class families (the very poor and paupers were a different matter). Relative stability reigned; the threat of rioting, revolution even, had diminished. Government had become more centralized and was passing bills on health, working hours and education. A modern civil service was being created. A network of railways was unifying the nation. The great public works era – notably in the provision of fresh water and the removal of sewage – had begun.</p>

<p>In the West End of London, fashionable and prestigious scientific and medical societies flourished that encouraged the professionalization of medicine and science. Most important for Livingstone was the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). Founded in 1830, the early years of this institution were undistinguished, but by mid century it had become an important centre for promoting exploration and imperial science. It is not surprising then that Livingstone looked to it for patronage and approval, and the RGS, in turn, sought its share of credit for Livingstone\'s work. It is not hard to imagine that Livingstone saw in the transformation of London some of the possibilities that science, technology, trade, and good British governance might bring to Africa.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s correspondence from the 1860s is that of a man who had seen the benefits of trade, science, and reform, especially in public health. Although the civilizing influence of Christianity is strong in them, there is also a highly developed sense of the health of the people as whole being an essential constituent of prosperity, happiness and salvation. Health in this case, he saw as conditioned in part by the environment, whether natural or managed.</p>

<p>Medicine, too, would have looked considerably different to Livingstone between 1838 and 1864. Bedside medicine – treating the sick person – changed profoundly in these years. When Livingstone was a young doctor, the patient\'s history was the key to diagnosis and management, as it had been for two millennia in the West. By the time he was a mature practitioner, physical examination aided by instruments was expected of every medical man.</p>

<p>In 1840 some still thought of the stethoscope, invented in 1816, as a toy. By 1865 its use was mandatory. A whole host of other instruments were also at the physician\'s disposal: for ears and eyes, the auroscope and ophthalmoscope could be used; the laryngoscope for the throat and, although modesty still surrounded its use, the vaginal speculum was deemed necessary for examination in women\'s diseases. The most modern practitioner might also have a microscope to examine the blood and urine. Drug therapy, though, changed little.</p>

<p>Surgery, however, had been transformed. While Livingstone was in Africa, ether and chloroform anaesthesia had been introduced, in 1846 and 1847 respectively. Surgical intervention, although largely confined to bones and soft tissues, had become amazingly ambitious and intricate by the mid 1860s. Exceptionally, the abdomen was now being opened for the removal of ovarian tumours.</p>

<p>Surgical deaths in the great hospitals, however, had increased considerably but Livingstone would have been well aware of the claims made by surgeons that science would solve this problem. Shortly after he returned to Africa in 1865, controversy would break out over Joseph Lister\'s antiseptic treatment based, he said, on Louis Pasteur\'s germ theory. Modern germ theory was not established until after Livingstone\'s death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Livingstone\'s lifetime, science at the bedside, in the laboratory and in the community was increasingly seen as a potent force in medicine. In retrospect, any claim made at the time that science helped the patient is a shaky one. What matters here are two consequences of the importance that the Victorians ascribed to science in medicine. First, the Victorians saw medicine, using science, as a tool for transforming people\'s lives and having the capacity to do so not only in Britain but also in the colonies – just as science and technology in general could.</p>

<p>Second, this image of science in medicine raised the status of the medical profession. What was once an elite vocation for the few was becoming a respectable middle-class occupation for the many. If Britain and the Empire were to thrive, doctors proclaimed, they could be its backbone (engineers and chemists said much the same thing). And, indeed, doctors and other professionals were eventually churned out in their thousands to serve in the colonies.</p>

<p>The production of the present critical edition required four years and the collective efforts of a project team numbering over twenty individuals. None of this work would have been possible without the support of the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> (NEH), one of the greatest cultural funding organizations in the United States. The project team is grateful to the NEH and its officers for making this edition possible and, most importantly, for infusing our project with a positive and vibrant spirit that carried the project through every stage, however difficult.</p>

<p>The project team would also like to acknowledge the considerable direct-cost contribution that the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) made to the development of our edition. Beyond this contribution, the staff of the UNL\'s <a href="http://www.unl.edu/english/home" target="_blank">English Department</a>, <a href="http://research.unl.edu/" target="_blank">Office for Research and Economic Development</a> (ORED), <a href="http://libraries.unl.edu/love-library" target="_blank">Love Library</a>, and the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities</a> (CDRH) provided extensive administrative support that allowed for the smooth functioning of the project from end to end.</p>

<p>Finally, the project directors would like to thank our team of encoders (listed by name on our <a href="/his-own-words/project-team">project team</a> page). The encoding of <a href="/islandora/search/NOT letter NOT spectral NOT shire NOT rumor NOT blotting NOT signatures?access=both_transcription&amp;f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A[1866+TO+1873]" target="_blank">over 2200 manuscript pages</a> required endurance, perseverance, and unflagging goodwill. Our encoders manifested these qualities in abundance and became the bedrock for all our accomplishments.</p>

<p>Throughout his final journey, Livingstone took notes in a series of pocket-sized diaries, jotting down narrative accounts of daily life, scientific observations, lists, drawings, and various other kinds of observations. Rather than following predetermined topics, Livingstone used a scattershot approach in the diaries, documenting his experiences and ideas as they arose. As a result, the diaries offer a more immediate, less filtered look at Livingstone’s interests, particularly as he tended to revise and redevelop key ideas and events from the diaries when he copied them into the <a href="/his-own-words/unyanyembe-journal-overview">Unyanyembe Journal</a> or recorded some of his ideas in letters to his correspondents.</p>

<p>Across the twelve diaries represented in this edition, though, three key theme emerge: ethnography, religion, and authority. Slavery and the slave trade also figure prominently in these diaries, but they arise consistently across these three main categories, demonstrating how slavery is a constant concern for Livingstone. Overall, close attention to the field diaries shows that they contain a rich vein of information about central African cultures, framed by British values in the form of Livingstone’s commentary and evaluations.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Ethnography</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span>⤴</a></span></h4>

<p class="space2">In his diaries, Livingstone made copious notes about the people and cultural practices he encountered, although he did not consider himself an ethnographer. He does, however, have consistent areas of interest when learning about other cultures, as well different strategies (lists, narratives, drawings) for representing those areas of interest and a philosophy of cross-cultural encounters. Livingstone’s observations are marked by a tension between his belief in approaching other cultures without prejudice and the implicit and unrecognized biases shaping his representations of African peoples.<a id="link3.1" name="link3.1"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Areas of Interest</strong>. Though Livingstone does not necessarily follow any clear guidelines when reporting on ethnic groups, the field diaries do show consistent areas of interest when taken as a whole. For instance, Livingstone repeatedly creates lists of local place names, new vocabulary words, and crops and agricultural practices. In addition, he usually notes clothing, ornamentation of teeth, and the presence or absence of tattoos and other forms of personal decoration, as when he says of the Makonde, “many of the men profusely tattooed - teeth sharpened to points they say for beauty” (1866a:[38]). At various times, he also records information about language, body type, skin color, facial features, hair, diet, and residential architecture. This is often the only cultural information Livingstone documents, and he jots down such observations even when contact is limited to only a few representatives of a given ethnic group.</p>

<p>Other pieces of information are reported second-hand from unnamed sources, as in another of Livingstone’s observations of the Makonde: “they are said to fear the English – They sell each other to the Arabs” (1866a:[56]). This quotation also points to Livingstone’s interest in and judgment of Africans’ complicity in the slave trade. He lectures chiefs not to sell their own people and judges those groups that engage in this practice as cowardly or mean.</p>

On the page in blue pencil, Livingstone discusses the practices of tatooing and tooth sharpening by an unnamed set of African villagers. The page in gray pencil, in a fashion typical of the field diaries, cycles through a range of topics, among them Livingstone\'s preparations for sailing on Lake Bangweolo, notes on the conduct of Livingstone\'s cook Halima, a reference to Livingstone\'s ill health, and a statement of his hope to complete his travels.</span></td>

<p>There are several other ethnographic questions that Livingstone returns to again and again, perhaps from personal curiosity or perhaps because these were open questions in the British imagination of Africa. His consistent observation of tattoos falls into this category, as do his more sparse – but still recurring – observations about possible cannibalism (also see the discussion of this topic in relation to the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-central-africa-1870#link10">1870 Field Diary</a> and the <a href="/his-own-words/unyanyembe-journal-overview#link3">Unyanyembe Journal</a>). Another practice that he disparagingly comments on many times is the habit of abstaining from sexual intercourse during the period a woman is breastfeeding, for up to three years after the birth of a baby.</p>

<p>This last detail is one of the few moments in which Livingstone describes a practice specific to women. It is typical in that women are largely conceived of in their relationship to others, usually as mothers, wives, or sexual partners. There are rare mentions of a particular woman, such as when Livingstone’s cook Halima informs on a man who has stolen some beads. Livingstone adds, “this was so far faithful in her but she has an outrageous tongue,” though it is unclear whether her “outrageous tongue” is a comment on her audacity in this moment or an assessment of her character through repeated exposure (1872h:[89]). For the most part, though, Livingstone’s diaries represent a man’s world, as he travels and lodges exclusively with men during his final journey.</p>

Illustration from the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874,1:146). <em>Courtesy of </em><a href="https://archive.org/details/lastjournalsofda01hora" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a><em>.</em> In the published text, illustrations of local African industrial practices can derive from sketches in Livingstone\'s diaries or journals, his prose descriptions, or a combination of the two.</span></p>

<p>When he feels that he has gotten to know an ethnic group, Livingstone attempts to characterize them more abstractly, describing such qualities as a group’s honesty, sympathy, avarice, or cowardice. Often, this comes in the form of comparisons to other groups. For instance, when Livingstone believes the Babisa have deceived him about the availability of food, he writes that they have “no more valour than the others but more craft” (1866f:[18]). This sense of ranking or trade-off of cultures in relation to one another is apparent again when he describes that the “Ketebe or Kapesha [as] very civil and generous” but also adds that the “men [are] very timid,” concluding that it is “no wonder the Arab slaves do as they choose with them” (1872h:[40]). Slavery, again, threads through his ethnographic observations as a reckoning of sorts, an evil that nonetheless tells us much about the individual personalities and cultural norms in which it is practiced.</p>

<p class="space2">Livingstone also gestures toward a belief in cultural progress, as when he compares African cultures to Scottish, saying that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Scot became “the apt pupil of more fortunate nations” and from this grew in industry, scholarship, and medicine (1866e:[100]). This sense of development, though, is not absolute, as he adds that the Africans he encounters “are not like our dangerous classes who borrow from civilization little but the art of masking evil &amp; of converting knowledge into cunning” (1866e:92]).<a id="link3.2" name="link3.2"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Forms of Representation.</strong> Livingstone typically divides each field diary, so that the first two-thirds or three-quarters contain his dated entries, arranged chronologically, and that the final third or quarter is oriented upside-down to the first portion and starts from back to front. In other words, it appears that he develops the two parts a given diary simultaneously – writing one front to back and the other back to front and upside-down relative to the first – so that the two sections meet in the middle. The front section is generally an ongoing record of travel, while the back section usually contains lists, maps, drawings, calculations, and shorter notes. This system thus divides each diary into two parts distinguished by function: narrative (first and longer section), non-narrative collections of observations and information (second and shorter section).</p>

<p class="space2">Though many of Livingstone’s more detailed descriptions of African cultures appear in the narrative sections at the front of the diaries, ethnographic information occupies much of the back section as well, especially in the form of drawings. This implies that Livingstone places importance on the visual aspects of interacting with other cultures and understands this information as different from longer descriptive passages. Often, he uses images to represent the differences he deemed significant between Africans and Europeans in physical appearance.<a id="link3.3" name="link3.3"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Philosophical Approach</strong>. Since Livingstone does not see himself as an ethnographer, he positions himself as someone whose knowledge is less theoretical, more grounded in practical experiences. Indeed, he believes that “[i]t is a most pernicious error of the Ethnographers that savages are influenced by fear alone,” suggesting that “the Ethnographers” are a separate group, often misled by ideas that do not prove true in practice (1866b:[103]).</p>

<p>This may be connected to a larger concern of Livingstone’s: that he be remembered as a “real” rather than “theoretical” explorer, an idea that he presents in his <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870 Field Diary</a> (Livingstone 1870c:II). A “real” explorer, in these terms, means not just one who spends time on the ground, but also one who has a mindset that oriented toward understanding local languages and cultures. In contrast with “the Ethnographers” above, Livingstone argues for approaching local peoples with curiosity rather than with the intention to inspire fear. Though he may deviate from this in practice, he seems sincerely to believe in the worth of an unbiased approach.</p>

A list of Swahili words from one of the notebooks included in the present edition. Livingstone often records such vocabulary ad hoc in his field diaries, then assembles it more systematically in intermediate documents such as this notebook. The range of words – which includes the terms for shampoo, lion, some cardinal directions, and "meat used in divination" – reflects Livingstone\'s interests as an explorer plus his attempts to understand the cultural practices of the populations among which he traveled.</span></p>

<p>As he begins his final journey, he writes these words, perhaps as much as a reminder for himself as for any future explorers: “A foreign people is not to be understood in a short or hurried visit – nor indeed to be appreciated by the oldest inhabitant, unless he will consent to waive all prejudice and live as one of themselves” (1865:[23]). Livingstone sees his field diaries as part of this mission. Though his records are not without prejudice, he indicates that they may be his way of addressing the difficulty of “realiz[ing] the true aspect of the people” and so document his attempts to “learn to respect their hearts” (1865:[23]).</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Religion</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span>⤴</a></span></h4>

<p class="space2">Although Livingstone’s does not formally undertake his final journey as a missionary, religion nonetheless plays a significant role in Livingstone’s interactions with Africans and Arabs, as well as his observations of local cultures. Christianity is also personally motivating to him, as he understands both his geographical exploration and his anti-slavery work as honoring his god and enabling him to withstand the trials of this journey.<a id="link4.1" name="link4.1"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>From Missionary to Abolitionist and Geographer</strong>. As the field diaries reveal, religion occupies a shifting role in Livingstone’s last journey. Since Livingstone is funded as a geographer rather than a missionary, Christianity is in the last journey integrated into Livingstone’s other objectives rather than prioritized. At times, Livingstone sees this integration as furthering missionary work, as when he comments that “An attention to man\'s happiness &amp; comfort and intellectual advancement in this life is essential for the promotion of his religious life” (1866a:[102]). In this, he underscores the Christianity and civilization doctrine he first imagined in <em>Missionary Travels </em>(1857), arguing for the promotion of European civilization in Africa as a moral good.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, however, we see Livingstone subsuming Christianity into what emerges as the primary goals of his last journey: geographic exploration and the abolition of slavery. In doing so, he maintains his belief that his work in Africa is for the glory of God even in the midst of changing and ambiguous goals for his third journey.</p>

<p>Each year on New Year’s Day, as well as at low moments, Livingstone recommits himself to his work by making a commitment to his god. For instance, after Henry M. Stanley leaves him in March 1872, Livingstone – who was in low spirits before he met Stanley and suffers a let-down in his absence – pledges on his birthday, “My Jesus, my King, my life, my all = I again dedicate my whole self to thee = accept me and grant O Gracious Father that ere this year is gone I may finish my task = In Jesus name I ask it - Amen, so let it be” (1871n:[48]-[49]). As he has almost every first of January since his journey began, Livingstone prays that he may complete his “task” within the coming year.</p>

<p>Though the task remains unnamed in these prayers, their repetition and his pledge demonstrate the extent to which Livingstone saw his geographic exploration as consistent with his earlier missionary work. Though he is no longer working explicitly toward conversion, he nonetheless sees his presence in Africa as a “task” that he labored at with God’s blessing. For instance, earlier in his final travels, he asks with slightly less urgency, “Almighty &amp; Gracious Father help me to be more profitable this year” (1867c:[116]). Though there is less urgency in this earlier version, there is still the same sense that Livingstone is racing against the clock, as he also asks, “If I am to die this year prepare me for it” (1867c:[116]).</p>

<p>In addition, Livingstone comes to see his anti-slavery work as a fulfillment of his missionary training. For instance, he reports preaching to the African headman Gombwa’s people that the Bible comments on the “the sin of selling his children.” He warns of a “Future state where all will be judged” and advises them “to expel enemies who came first as slave traders” (1866d:[68]-[69]). In these moments when the opportunity to preach arises, Livingstone increasingly passes over basic tenets of Christianity to preach ideas directly aimed at proving slavery wrong.</p>

<p class="space2">In particular, Livingstone targets the African practice of selling other Africans (often prisoners of war, criminals, or those out of favor). He reports that a headman named Kremasusa wants to show Livingstone the result of following this advice: “He was anxious that I should see another village which he now has from following my advice not to sell his people” (1866d:[45]). Though Kremasusa shows no sign that this new practice is religious in nature, Livingstone nonetheless attributes it to his own work in spreading the idea in God’s name.<a id="link4.2" name="link4.2"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Comparative Religions</strong>. The field diaries also show Livingstone’s interest in comparative religious observation. He is particularly interested in the difference between the Christian belief in conversion and the lack of desire in his Muslim companions to proselytize. To Livingstone, this is a moral failing: “No oriental comprehends the meaning of benefitting the people” (1865:[21]). Later he avers that religion “requires perpetual propagation to attest its genuineness” (1872g:[122])</p>

<p>There are signs, though, that Livingstone’s call to proselytize is regarded by others with equal suspicion. When discussing the slave trade with chief Mukate, he reports, “Arabs have told him that our object in capturing slaves was to make them our own slaves and of our own religion” (1866d:[21]). In this, Livingstone records the intersection of several conflicts: the slave trade, vying for locals’ favor, and different understandings of the role of religion.</p>

<p>Livingstone plays his own role in that conflict, often characterizing Islam and other religions as mere superstitions or, worse yet, as hypocritical, as when he records the holdings of brandy and gin by the “Moslems” (1871n:[78]). His assessments of religion are often colored by individual interactions, as when he first meets chief Chitanga and tells him “about God &amp; Bible to which he returned intelligent remarks” (1866f:[83]-[84]). Later, however, after Livingstone and chief have a difference of opinion on an unrelated matter, Livingstone amends this assessment: “it is little that his mind can take in” (1866f:[88]).</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;display:inline-block;text-align:left">The Arrival of Hamees\' Bride. Illustration from the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874,1:opposite 232). <em>Courtesy of </em><a href="https://archive.org/details/lastjournalsofda01hora" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a><em>.</em> Such exoticized cultural illustrations in the published text contrast with the evolving nature of Livingstone\'s ideas on religion as recorded in his field diaries, particularly in regards to his developing a more comparative perspective on Christianity.</span></p>

<p>At other points, however, he accepts (sometimes grudgingly) that “They” – in this case, chief Hamees’ people – “seem to be religious in their way” (1867c[23]). In this, Livingstone begins to contextualize Christianity within a wider picture, both geographically and historically, rather than simply reaffirming its superiority. For instance, he observes that in the east, Christianity is a relatively new religion and therefore potentially subversive. It is regarded, he notes, “as many of ourselves do Mormonism” (1865:[20]).</p>

<p>With this, Livingstone also represents religion as a cultural phenomenon. In response to learning that they share a creation story (described as “‘such a one who died’”), he speculates that the Manganja people, as well as other groups situated near Lake Tanganyika and the Zambesi River, “are one &amp; followed the course of great waters going Southwards” (1866d:[25]). In making this connection, he associates religious beliefs with geographic location and ethnic groups rather than with progress toward a single, transcendent truth.</p>

<p class="space2">Livingstone occupies a liminal place as an authority figure. On the one hand, he is the leader of his expedition with the power to reward or punish his men as he sees fit. He also shows an implicit belief in his own authority as a white Christian European, sometimes asserting his moral code and belief system as superior to others that he encounters. On the other hand, he is often as the mercy of others’ authority, as when his men threaten to mutiny, local groups clash, or he cannot move forward without forming unsavory alliances. This section attempts to capture the ways that Livingstone’s representations of his authority in his diaries shifts over time and place by exploring Livingstone’s assessment of African leadership in conjunction with his own struggle, both with his porters and as a result of the fallout from violent local conflicts.<a id="link5.1" name="link5.1"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>African Leadership</strong>. Livingstone notes differences in leadership styles as he moves through different regions and among different ethnic groups. These differences are often judged not only through chiefs’ treatment of their own people and other African tribes, but even more frequently through the responses of these individuals to slavery and to Livingstone himself.</p>

<p>Though Livingstone himself often works with Arab slave traders to achieve his own ends, he describes chiefs who appease these same traders as childlike, weak, or scared. For example, Livingstone argues that the chief Chitapangwa has been “spoiled” by his contact with traders (1867f:[83]). With these chiefs, Livingstone sometimes digs in his heels to get what he wants. He seems to see their authority as more malleable in relation to his own, even when the chief in question actually has great power in the situation. Livingstone drives a hard bargain with Chitapangwa, for instance, despite the fact that Chitapangwa threatens to send them back across the Chambezi to famine (1867f:[83]-[84]).</p>

<p>With more tyrannical leaders such as the chief Cazembe, Livingstone criticizes their approach as “barbarity” but nonetheless accords them respect (1867c:[85]). He writes admiringly of the “grand reception” Cazembe throws him, evidently seeing this as a rightful recognition of Livingstone’s own importance (1867c:[87]).</p>

<p class="space2">Livingstone sometimes presumes to know better than African chiefs what would be good for their people, at least once punishing a villager against the wishes of the headman (1871n:[169]). Livingstone seems to feel justified in this conduct especially when slavery is concerned, as when he enters a village where “some had bought or stolen little children” and Livingstone “order[s] them to be returned.” When “one swore that he did not know from whom he got the child,” Livingstone gives “one blow as a thief &amp; ordered him out of the camp” (1872h:[48]). He seems to feel an authority – religious, racial, ethnic, or a combination of the three – that transcends other hierarchies, as he routinely orders Africans not to engage in buying or selling others.<a id="link5.2" name="link5.2"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Troubles with His Men</strong>. Livingstone’s judgment of African leadership seems hypocritical when we consider his struggles with his own men. From the beginning, Livingstone struggles with the different ethnic groups that make up his porters, with conflicts arising over language differences and the difficulty of their marches, all intensified by frequent bouts of food scarcity. In describing these conflicts, Livingstone often attributes them to ethnic differences (e.g., the African porters are less “lazy” than the “Nassickers,” a group of freed slaves educated at a school in Nashik, India) (1866c:[52]).</p>

<p>When mutiny arises from the sepoys (Indian soldiers in the British army), Livingstone feels himself caught between military authorities in India and fear of what the sepoys will do to the Makonde people, fearing that the sepoys will bring “disgrace on the English name” (1866b:[29]). In these instances, Livingstone understands his authority as circumscribed by British hierarchies and values more than by local conflicts. At other moments, however, Livingstone is not afraid to assert his authority through physical punishment, such as caning.</p>

<p class="space2">This is not to suggest, however, that Livingstone sees his authority as only arising from punishment. He feels a bond with certain of his men and believes that they serve him out of loyalty rather than fear. For instance, he feels betrayed when his porter Chuma hides his own flour in a time of extreme hunger so as not to share it: “I had always given him a part of any food I got [ . . . ] as a sort of member of my family” (1866f:[47]). These differences in leadership result, not surprisingly, in very different relationships with his men and the duration of their service.<a id="link5.3" name="link5.3"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Local Conflicts</strong>. In addition, Livingstone tends not to acknowledge the extent to which his authority is intertwined with that of Africans. Good conditions tend to reduce unrest among Livingstone’s men, while tensions flare during times of hunger and hardship. So, a chief or headman who feeds and shelters Livingstone and his men inadvertently reinforces Livingstone’s authority, as he, Livingstone, is less likely to be challenged.</p>

<p>Conversely, local conflicts can circumscribe Livingstone’s authority. The most obvious examples of this are the various relationships between Arab traders and regional African villagers. When traveling with Arab traders, for instance, Livingstone reports that he is barred from contact with Africans: “came to a village stockaded &amp; all the people outside with gates shut - afraid of the Arabs (1867c:[26]).</p>

<p class="space2">Livingstone also repeatedly notes that the introduction of firearms changes the way that he is treated: “the terror guns have inspired is extreme” (1872h:[46]). Sometimes this means that his own firearms command respect, but more often it means that he cannot barter for food or learn geographical information because he has been prevented from engaging with local peoples.<a id="link5.4" name="link5.4"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Fluidity of Authority</strong>. Taken together, Livingstone’s writings show how authority is locally constituted and can shift quickly in different situations. Though Livingstone has a bedrock sense of his own authority as a Christian European man, he nonetheless frequently submits to others’ authority, as when he travels with Arabs or avoids the violent conflict with the Mazitu ethnic group.</p>

<p>In 1873, near the end of his life, Livingstone asses his own leadership style thus: “I have gone among the whole population kindly &amp; fairly but I fear that I must now act more rigidly for when they hear that we have submitted to injustice they at once conclude that we are fair game for all” (1872h:[97]). This stems from Livingstone’s firm sense that “submit[ing] to injustice” ruins a person’s integrity and therefore his authority.</p>

An excellent example of the multiple strategies that Livingstone employs to convey his observations of Africa in an authoritative fashion in his field diaries, including drawings, narrative prose, and geographical calculations. One implication of integrated representations such as this one is that each piece of data supplements and reinforces the others.</span></p>

<p>At the same time, however, Livingstone also records situations in which personal freedom shifts rapidly, as when he engages two “smart young Waiyau men” who had been “bought at Mbanga &amp; Mukate’s by Babisa but the Mazitu killed all their Manganja masters &amp; now they are free” (1866e:[66]). Livingstone believes the Nassickers to be permanently corrupted and unable to command respect because they are former slaves: “some are slaves in spite of all that was done” (1867c:[25]-[26]). Yet, he engages these Waiyau men with the belief that their tenure as slaves is reversible.</p>

<p>Livingstone himself, it seems, clings to the idea that personal qualities such as bravery and a solid work ethic dictate authority as much as or more than circumstances. Ultimately, though, he sees authority as only as good as the ends it achieves. Here, once again, the slave trade influences his practices. Toward the end of his life, he writes that he wishes to complete his geographical quest because “To do all alone will give me an influence and name which I pray may be turned for good in the abolition of this nasty slave trade” (1872g:[29]).</p>

<p>The twelve field diaries available in this edition cover a wealth of information beyond the themes traced in this essay, including observations on medicine, politics, Arab culture, and African geography, ecology, and culture. This essay has highlighted some of Livingstone’s most pervasive concerns – ethnography, religion, and authority – as well as demonstrated how Livingstone considers the slave trade in relation to each of these issues. Throughout the field diaries, we can see the tension inherent in Livingstone’s position; the very act of representing African and Arab cultural practices reflects his own cultural position, his biases, and his beliefs. The field diaries are interesting cultural artifacts not only for the information they contain but for the complex representational strategies Livingstone employs.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary reflects a range of information sources although most of the diary details Livingstone’s time spent in one place, the central African village of Bambarre, where he was immobilized due to ill health. In this, the diary arguably offers an excellent snapshot of Livingstone’s experiences in a “contact zone,” Mary Louise Pratt’s seminal term for the “social spaces where disparate cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in highly asymmetrical relations of domination and subordination” (Pratt 1992:24).</p>

<p>In the decades since Pratt’s work, scholars have worked to add nuance to this understanding of contact narratives by resisting a simple tale of domination and subordination while identifying the dialogue and cooperation that existed alongside the "clash[ing], and grappl[ing]" that Pratt identified. One historian, for instance, has argued that “Much of the information brought back by explorers was derived from what Africans told them” (Bridges 1998:73). This has given rise to the problem of how best to "acknowledge the ethical value of dialogue” between colonizer and colonized “without erasing from view the uneven relations of domination and resistance characteristic of modern colonialism and imperialism" (Barnett 1998:240).</p>

<p>Livingstone has long acted as a kind of lightning rod for this problem, as his role in relation to imperial oppression continues to be debated (J. Livingstone 2014). Critics have variously interpreted the assistance that Livingstone received from local African populations, Arab traders, Indian financiers, and others as either reinforcing or undermining the colonial power dynamic. To some critics, this “appropriation” tends to “see African compliance in the colonial enterprise as affirming a spiritual and familiar bond between colonizer and colonized” (Spurr 1993:33). Others understand indigenous guides and information sources as “intermediaries,” who “often possessed far more power than explorers were prepared to admit, since it undermined their own reputations” (Kennedy 2013:162-63). Livingstone, on these readings, continues as the face of colonial power, regardless of whether that is undermined or reinforced.</p>

<p>In the 1870 Field Diary, a complex picture of intercultural relations surfaces. For instance, within Bambarre, Livingstone encounters a diverse mixture of Africans, Arab, and Indian populations. These populations divide not only along ethnic and geographic lines and but also between slaves and free men – a division that begins to complicate the “asymmetrical relations” cited above. In addition, the immobilized Livingstone makes a sustained attempt to acquire geographical information from non-Western informants. Finally, he faces a lack of supplies and a mutinying group of attendants, factors that complicate his geographical mission. These complications, alone and in combination, all circumscribe Livingstone’s lived and discursive authority as well as his work as a geographer. The complications also influence Livingstone’s strategies as a diarist and collector of information.</p>

<p>This essay proposes that we investigate the 1870 Field Diary as a record of information gathered from multiple, overlapping and competing sources, even though the diary (and other records of like it) have typically been read as a single source, first-hand account of European travel in Africa. The essay also argues that in his diary Livingstone conceives of his non-Western interlocutors as separate, lesser entities – individuals not on par with classical authorities such as Ptolemy and Herodotus.</p>

<p>On this reading, the 1870 Field Diary emerges as a palimpsest of diverse information economies or discursive and material strategies Livingstone employs to negotiate trade-offs in money, goods, and prestige as he gathers geographic knowledge. Rather than an instantiated example of an imperial correspondence model that links the metropole with “other, similar interests elsewhere in the colonial ‘peripheries,’” the 1870 Field Diary encodes the network of competing interests at the colonial site (Lester 2001:7-8). In short, Livingstone’s diary acts as a record of intersecting cultural interests and at once encodes European authority and the many moments where that authority stumbles.</p>

<p>Livingstone directs the narrative of the 1870 Field Diary towards European knowledge production and writes to a European audience through his descriptions of African geography and culture as well as in his ruminations on life as an explorer. In doing so, he distinguishes himself as a “real” rather than a “theoretical” explorer and evaluates the contributions of other explorers to scientific discourse in relation to his own goals (Livingstone 1870c:II). In this approach, the non-Western populations whom Livingstone encounters and with whom he converses do not qualify as explorers at all, regardless of the information they transmit. This move isolates him from the populations that surround him.</p>

<p>Yet in the narrative of the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone also finds himself more imbricated in his local circumstances than ever before. He also comes to depend on others for much of the information he records in his diary during this time, thanks to the ulcers that have immobolized him. Sometimes such dependence is implicit. When Livingstone uses the passive voice in his diary, the source of information can be difficult to discern (1870j:LXVII). At other times, the dependance on others is explicit. For instance, in August 1870, Muhamad Bogharib, an Arab trader, sends his men on an expedition at Livingstone’s behest. In exchange for “two thousands [sic] Rupees &amp; a gun,” Muhamad’s men explore the surrounding area and report back that there is not much of interest (Livingstone 1870b:[32]). In this way, Livingstone appears to lend to the information gathered from non-Western informants the same credibility as he does to his own first-hand observations.</p>

<p>In other words, circumstances compel Livingstone to cede some amount of his geographical authority. With this, we find Livingstone’s authority failing in other realms as well, perhaps because he cannot rely on movement, discovery, and further exploration to solidify his position. When the Nassickers (a group of nine men recruited for Livingstone’s journey from a government-run school for freed slaves in Nashik, India) refuse to explore on his behalf, Livingstone details the erosion of his lived authority: “I am powerless as they have left me and think that they may do as they like [...]” (1870b:[57]). This erosion occurs in part because because of the Nassickers’ sexual practices with local women: “the head Arabs told me that [the Nassick men] were in the habit of going to the [Manyema] women whose husbands were away and getting food and spending the night with them” (1870b:[14]). Livingstone here navigates a complicated overlay of conflicting loyalties: the Nassickers’ questionable loyalty to him, their behavior toward local women, and the disruption to the local population’s domestic and sexual norms caused by the outsiders.</p>

<p>The Arab traders in Bambarre extend this process. Livingstone refuses to “punish as the Arabs do,” on moral grounds, and the result is that he fears his men see him as weak (1870b:[20]). In response, Livingstone shores up his own moral authority, as when he records the esteem with which local African populations approach him: “They have found out that I am not a slaver and when the people remain stand calling as I pass – ‘This is the good one. ‘Bolongo.’ Friendship Friendship’” (1870e:XIII). Yet, for all that Livingstone condemns Arab discipline, he also depends on the Arab traders for friendship, to provide him supplies, and, ultimately, to facilitate his travels, which only complicates the situation further.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because Livingstone finds himself at the intersection (and sometimes the mercy of) these multicultural forces, his lived authority falters and this failing extends to his discursive authority. The 1870 Field Diary reveals traces both of Livingstone’s powerlesness and the changed information economy in which he operates. The European center has become irrelevant, replaced by cultural heterogeneity, and the diary emerges as a repository of multiple narrative accounts and structures of authority. Livingstone’s apparent geographical isolation causes a kind of being in the world most evident when he records overlapping sources of information. This information diaspora is, of course, still mediated through Livingstone and his European (primarily British) framework, but tracing its existence reveals the multiple vectors that ultimately shape European knowledge production.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s geographical observations perhaps best capture this process, specifically its inherent unruliness, Livingstone’s attempts to corral it, and his own blind spots. When Livingstone notes, “I have to go down the central Lualaba or Webb’s lake river – Then up the Western or Young[‘]s lake river to Katanga head waters &amp; then retire – I pray that it may be to my native home” (1870h:XVIII), he overlays and interchanges British names which he himself has imposed on local African geographical features (Webb’s lake river, Young’s lake river) with the local names (Lualaba, Katanga).</p>

The map charts the rivers crossed by Ramadan and Hassani, two Arab traders, in August and September 1870. In other words, the layout of the map is based wholly on geographical details collected from Livingstone\'s informants.</span></p>

<p>This interweaving suggests that he cannot – even for his intended British audience – simply use the new names, unless they are paired with local names. In other words, his wish to leave Africa and return to, ironically, his “native home” (Livingstone 1870h:XVIII) – where the names are singular – underscores the extent to which he is juggling multiple lived and discursive frameworks while in Bambarre. Livingstone may attempt to frame himself as a European writing to his “home reader,” but the information diaspora in which he operates erodes the self-other boundary on which that frame depends.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Livingstone’s limitation lies in believing himself much less in the world than he really is. In “long[ing] excessively to be away” (1870i:XXVIII), he fails to understand that such an escape is not possible. His work actually depends upon recourse to and immersion in a variety of information sources, from his own first-hand observations, to classical authorities such as Ptolemy and Herodotus, to the diverse populations he encounters in Bambarre. It is not just a matter of inscribing his name in classical or contemporary British geographical conversations.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s journey to Africa might seem focused on reaching the distant source(s) of the Nile, so that he can deliver this information to Europe in order to reconfirm his standing as one of the leading British explorers of the day. However, the 1870 Field Diary reveals that the journey to those sources depends on sources of another kind: non-Western informants. Attention to these latter sources in a critical reading of the diary, in turn, illuminates the rich cultural confluence from which seemingly single-authored imperial texts might sometimes emerge.</p>

Attention to Livingstone’s use of these sources illuminates broader strategies by which Victorian travel writers converted experiences – over which they sometimes exerted limited influence – into authoritative and controlled narratives of the field.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Groundwork (2010-13)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span>⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">first phase</a> (2010-13) of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project demonstrated that spectral imaging could recover faded nineteenth-century text written over the pages of a newspaper. Image capture work <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-history-1#link10">in 2010</a> produced not only all the images of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary required for the first phase, but also all the images of the 1870 Field Diary, five 1871 letters, and the 1870 “Retrospect” necessary for a separate, second phase project on these texts.</p>

<p>However, since the latter three texts appeared fairly legible under natural light, [qtip: Adrian S. Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], the director of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project, gradually decided to turn the work of the second phase in a new direction by investigating whether spectral imaging could help scholars study the material features of these manuscripts.</p>

With one small exception, all the surviving fragments of the 1870 Field Diary reside at these two institutions.</span></p>

<p>Specifically, this approach raised a series of questions. Could spectral imaging reveal the history of these texts over the last century and a half? Could we use the technology to learn about a) the sequence in which Livingstone composed his works, b) the effect of the many individuals who had handled the texts before and after Livingstone’s death, and c) the impact of the multiple environments through which the manuscripts circulated?</p>

<p>To take up these questions, the project team, led by Wisnicki, submitted proposals to the Wellcome Trust, the Mellon Foundation, and Google in order to fund the development of this second phase. All these proposals proved unsuccessful. Yet despite time otherwise lost on such applications, the proposals did allow the team to hone their research objectives and refine the proposed project narrative.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the project team decisively turned for the better when [qtip: Megan Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], also a Victorianist, joined the project (after reading about the project’s first phase on the NEH website) and when the team made a grant application for the NEH’s <a href="https://www.neh.gov/grants/research/scholarly-editions-and-translations-grants" target="_blank">Scholarly Translations and Editions Grant</a> on 6 December 2012. Ward brought a much-needed theoretical frame to the application of spectral imaging for studying material history.</p>

<p>The new application noted that the team hoped to use spectral image processing to “enhance illegible portions of Livingstone’s text, reveal manuscript topography, highlight environmental traces on the manuscript pages, and differentiate the inks used by Livingstone and others in correcting and marking up the text” and noted that “These features tell their own story about the construction and history of the manuscripts.” The team received news of the positive outcome of this application on 24 July 2013. A few months later, on 1 December 2013, the project launched.</p>

<p>The funded project, as designed, brought together a core set of four individuals for the main work – scholars [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], and two imaging scientists who had also played a key role in the first phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project, [qtip: Roger L. Easton Jr.|Roger L. Easton Jr. (Professor, Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology). One of the lead scientists for both phases of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Keith Knox|Keith Knox (Early Manuscripts Electronic Library). One of the lead scientists for both phases of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.].</p>

<p>This core team, in turn, engaged a handful of people to provide strategic support, including TEI encoding specialist [qtip: James Cummings|James Cummings (IT Services, University of Oxford). TEI specialist for <em>Livingstone Online</em> and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and data manager [qtip: Doug Emery|Doug Emery(Programmer, Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies, University of Pennsylvania). Data manager for the first phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project; honorary team member of the second project phase ….], although the latter left the project before it began in order to take a full-time position at the University of Pennsylvania. It was envisioned that the UCLA Digital Library would publish the materials of this phase, as it had of the previous phase.</p>

<p>The NEH grant narrative called for two principal deliverables:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) [A c]omplete, interoperable electronic edition of Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary and select 1871 manuscripts that reflects the scholarly, scientific, archival, and documentation standards established by the NEH funded electronic edition of <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary</a>.<br />
2) All proposed edition underlying TIFF images, XML transcriptions, and metadata provided separately as “flat” files and integrated into the <a href="/islandora/search?access=view_spectral">Livingstone Spectral Image Collection</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, this new phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project would publish the relevant digital materials in a manner consistent with and at a level of quality comparable to the <a href="http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/1871diary/index.htm" target="_blank">first phase</a>.</p>

The plan, in this excerpt, tracks the development of critical materials over the span of a year (Aug. 2015-Aug. 2016).</span></p>

<p>To guide the work, in the first year of the project the team used the workplan provided in the NEH grant narrative. As a first step, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] converted this plan into a streamlined program plan and, in doing so, determined to outline the work of the project on a yearly basis so as to be as responsive as possible to actual project progress. The two scholars then reviewed the first-year plan with the two scientists, finalized the plan, and the project formally got underway.</p>

<p>The first year of the project intermingled a series of foundational activities. To begin, Wisnicki and Ward examined existing spectral images of the 1870 Field Diary, the 1871 letters, and the 1870 “Retrospect” to identify regions of interests (ROIs) for new processing. They first linked the broad, grant narrative-defined processing objectives to multi-page segments of the manuscript. Then, as they began to transcribe the manuscript, they used the initial review to guide the identification of specific ROIs on each page. Finally, they extracted this data to spreadsheets that they shared and reviewed with the scientists in order to develop a prioritized spectral image processing task list.</p>

<p>(For an overview of the processing methods used by the scientists, see the <a href="http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/1871diary/image_processing.htm" target="_blank">project history</a> of the first phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.)</p>

<p>Once the scientists began processing the raw spectral images of the manuscripts, they used the task list as their guide for sequencing research. The workflow soon settled into a regular pattern. The scientists selected one or more prioritized tasks, then applied a variety of algorithms in an effort to address scholar needs. When ready, the scientists shared the results with the scholars who provided feedback.</p>

<p>Feedback took the form of written commentary as well as discussion during what soon became regular meetings. In other words, the workflow assumed an iterative and highly collaborative character that persisted till the end of the processing work in year two of the grant and became the basis of the project’s continuing momentum.</p>

<p>As image processing developed, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] worked on transcribing, encoding, and annotating Livingstone’s manuscripts using the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/" target="_blank">TEI P5 guidelines</a>. The drafting of a detailed Livingstone manuscript <a href="http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-ODD/leap.html" target="_blank">coding manual</a> through another NEH-funded project (<a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2017">LEAP: The Livingstone Online Enrichment and Access Project</a>, 2013-17) considerably enhanced and facilitated this work, as did input from [qtip: James Cummings|James Cummings (IT Services, University of Oxford). TEI specialist for <em>Livingstone Online</em> and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] on thorny coding questions and the assistance of [qtip: Ashanka Kumari|Ashanka Kumari (Doctoral Student, University of Louisville). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], Wisnicki’s graduate research assistant. Additionally, the work benefited from preliminary TEI transcriptions of the 1871 letters created by Wisnicki and [qtip: Kate Simpson|Kate Simpson (Research Associate, Queen\'s University Belfast). Associate project scholar and UK outreach coordinator for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] in the first phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.</p>

<p>Thanks to these combined efforts, the scholars (Wisnicki, Ward, and now Kumari) succeeded in completing fully encoded and edited transcriptions of all relevant manuscripts by the end of the first year of the grant – a full six months ahead of schedule. Transcription also resulted in initial research on the structure and composition of the 1870 Field Diary, although this research did not get fully underway until the second year of the grant.</p>

<p>As a result, the first year of the grant was quite productive. Although some unforeseen complications outside of the project’s purview delayed a handful of project tasks (most notably, image processing), the team nonetheless made solid and demonstrable progress towards realizing overall project objectives.</p>

<p><a id="link4" name="link4"></a></p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Year Two (1 Dec. 2014 to 30 Nov. 2015)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span>⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The project team began the second year of the grant like they did the first, by using the NEH grant application workplan to develop a program plan for the coming year. With the plan in place, the core team carried on with its regular meetings and continued to address spectral image processing objectives.</p>

<p>The image processing work produced excellent results and by the end of the second project year, the team had completed nearly all objectives set out in the grant. [qtip: Knox|Keith Knox (Early Manuscripts Electronic Library). One of the lead scientists for both phases of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Easton|Roger L. Easton Jr. (Professor, Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology).

Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], produced a <a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images">broad assortment of spectral images</a> that ultimately facilitated detailed study of manuscript elements such as composition, handling, and preservation (see the six-part <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">State of the Manuscript</a> essay).</p>

<p>Moreover, the ongoing and extensive discussions between the scholars and the scientists resulted in additional benefits. The discussions enabled the team to examine the production history of Livingstone’s manuscript in a robust, detailed, and highly interdisciplinary manner that, later, considerably influenced critical analysis (again, as exemplified in project’s six-part <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">State of the Manuscript</a> essay). Regular meetings also kept the project on point, helped clarify both scholar research questions and scientists processing capabilities, and, ultimately, led to the introduction of new processing techniques that significantly enhanced project work.</p>

<p>Alongside such research, Wisnicki, Ward, [qtip: Kumari|Ashanka Kumari (Doctoral Student, University of Louisville). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], and [qtip: Erin Cheatham|Erin Cheatham (Graduate Student, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] (another of Wisnicki’s graduate research assistants at UNL) continued with their critical encoding of Livingstone’s manuscripts and the development of critical materials. In the second year, the scholars encoded the portions of <a href="/islandora/search?f[]=creator_ms%3A&quot;Livingstone%2C+Agnes+3%2C+1847-1912&quot;&amp;f[]=repository_ms%3A&quot;Bodleian+Library.+Weston+Library&quot;&amp;f[]=genre_ms%3A&quot;autographs+(manuscripts)&quot;">Agnes Livingstone’s transcription</a> of the 1870 Field Diary for which original pages did not survive and encoded the sections of the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874) corresponding to the 1870 Field Diary.</p>

<p>Through LEAP, their other NEH grant, the scholars also transcribed the portion of Livingstone’s Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) that corresponded to the 1870 Field Diary. As a final step in the encoding process, [qtip: Heather F. Ball|Heather F. Ball (Project Cataloger, The Morgan Library &amp; Museum). Coordinating Associate Project Scholar for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], associate project scholar for <em>Livingstone Online</em>, integrated all transcriptions to overall site standards.</p>

<p>These collective encoding accomplishments would enable the team to publish <a href="/islandora/search/&quot;1870 Field Diary&quot;?f[]=genre_ms:&quot;spectral+color&quot;">the most complete version of the 1870 Field Diary possible</a> and would also allow for <a href="/spectral-imaging/three-versions-1870-field-diary">comparative study</a> of the Livingstone’s original manuscript with the revised versions from his journal and the posthumously edited, published version of the text.</p>

<p>Additionally, the scholars undertook extensive work on a <a href="/spectral-imaging/glossary-key-terms-livingstones-manuscripts-1870-71">glossary of key terms</a> cited in Livingstone’s 1870-1871 manuscripts, ultimately identifying and/or defining some 500 distinct people, groups, places, and geographical features. Research for the glossary helped enhance the existing encoded transcriptions, clarified geographical details, and facilitated the scholars in understanding some of the complex social relationships among the many African and Arab individuals cited in Livingstone’s texts.</p>

<p>The scholars pursued this research while completing an essay on <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-composition-practices">Livingstone’s composition methods</a> during the period in question, writing the first two parts of what would eventually become the six-part <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">State of the Manuscript</a> essay, and commencing research on an essay on <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-global-sources">Livingstone\'s sources</a>. Additionally, [qtip: Alex Munson|Alex Munson (Graduate Student, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Research assistant for the critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts.], another graduate research assistant, provided research support for the State of the Manuscript essay.</p>

<p>As a means to disseminating research, the second year of the project included a week-long visit to stakeholder institutions in the UK, and a presentation on the project at the annual North American Victorian Studies Association conference (NAVSA, July 2016). [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] also delivered an invited talk to P19, the Philadelphia Nineteenth-Century Studies Group.</p>

<p>The UK trip created the opportunity for in-person consultation of the 1870 Field Diary and another diary related to the project (Livingstone 1869) at the National Library of Scotland and to engage in dissemination activities in the form of meetings with David Livingstone Centre staff and meetings and lectures at the National Library of Scotland and the British Library.</p>

<p>The NAVSA paper, which [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] delivered on behalf of the project team, became one of nine such papers selected to represent the conference in a special 2016 issue of <em>Victorian Studies</em> – a recognition of the project preliminary results.</p>

<p>Finally, during the project’s second year, the team began to plan publication of the critical edition. When the team submitted its original NEH application in December 2012, it did not anticipate that this project and the team’s other application to the NEH (for LEAP) would both be funded, as they were. This turn of events had significant positive implications in the context of the proposed critical edition.</p>

<p>For instance, the redevelopment of <em>Livingstone Online</em> through LEAP eliminated the need for an independently developed edition interface for 1870 Field Diary and 1870-71 manuscripts because the edition could now be embedded in <em>Livingstone Online</em>. Moreover, since both NEH projects ran concurrently, the project team not only had the chance to draw on other capabilities developed for LEAP, such as the <em>Livingstone Online</em> <a href="http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-ODD/leap.html" target="_blank">coding manual</a>, but also to develop core spectral image data in line with <em>Livingstone Online</em> <a href="/behind-scenes/practices-standards-and-arrangements">practices</a>, a fact that would later enable the straightforward addition this image data to <em>Livingstone Online</em>’s <a href="/his-own-words/livingstone-online-digital-collection">digital collection</a>.</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">\'Funeral of Dr. Livingstone in Westminster Abbey.\' Illustration from a review of Livingstone\'s <em>Last Journals</em> in the <em>Illustrated London News</em>, 64 (1874): 401. <em>Copyright National Library of Scotland. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/scotland/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Share-alike 2.5 UK: Scotland</a></em>. Livingstone carried the 1870 Field Diary with him until his death in central Africa in 1873. The diary then accompanied his body to Britain where Livingstone received a burial in one of Britain\'s most important churches, while his heirs distributed the diary to a number of Britain\'s leading archives.</span></p>

<p>Such collaborations gave the team a significant head start on edition interface development for the 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts. This also enabled [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] to turn their attention – during the last months of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 – to transitioning <em>Livingstone Online</em> (and, by default, the second phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project) from the UCLA Digital Library to the University of Maryland Libraries.</p>

<p>This transition resulted from complications in the collaborative relationship with UCLA to be discussed in the final part of the LEAP project history (forthcoming 2017). The immediate results of these complications, beyond the shift to the new hosting institution, entailed the addition of programmer [qtip: Nigel Banks|Nigel Banks (Independent programmer). Lead developer for the critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts.] to both project teams to replace UCLA for Islandora development and, separately, a decision by Wisnicki (in collaboration with core team members on both projects) to extend each of the two grants by a year in order to ensure that both grants met all application narrative commitments in full.</p>

<p>Consequently, despite the need for an extension, the spectral imaging project team continued to make solid progress during the second year of the grant, especially in areas such as image processing, critical encoding, developing critical materials, building core data, and disseminating results to stakeholders and specialists. This work both advanced project goals considerably and, in all cases, met or exceeded the standards of scholarship set by the first project phase on <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary</a>.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the third project year, the team had successfully developed nearly all the most important core data, including required spectral images and critically encoded versions of all relevant manuscripts.</p>

<p>In the third year, therefore, project scholars [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] (with assistance from [qtip: Kumari|Ashanka Kumari (Doctoral Student, University of Louisville). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.]) turned to the written analysis of this data. Working at a steady pace, the scholars completed in succession:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1. the essay, <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-global-sources">Livingstone’s Global Sources</a>;<br />
2. the last four parts of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary">State of the Manuscript</a> essay;<br />
3. final research on the <a href="/spectral-imaging/glossary-key-terms-livingstones-manuscripts-1870-71">glossary</a>;<br />
4. the addition of tags to the transcriptions that allowed all glossary entries to appear as tooltips when the transcriptions were published online;<br />
5. a <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript-citation-and-file-naming-practices">manuscript citation and file naming guide</a>;<br />
6. a <a href="/spectral-imaging/integrated-project-bibliography">comprehensive bibliography</a> for both phases of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project; and<br />
7. an <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">introduction</a> to the second phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project as a whole.</p>

<p>In addition, Wisnicki developed the XSL and CSS files needed to display all edited and encoded texts online, assembled all <a href="/spectral-imaging/project-documentation">project documentation</a>, and worked with Ward to write an introduction to the documentation and to draft the present project history. During this time, [qtip: Anne Martin|Anne Martin (Archivist, David Livingstone Centre). Associate director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] (David Livingstone Centre) and [qtip: Alison Metcalfe|Alison Metcalfe (Manuscripts Curator, National Library of Scotland).

<p>As spectral image data came in, Wisnicki led the integration of all spectral images and transcriptions, added detailed metadata to image headers, and built downloadable archival packets that would allow users to interact with this data independently of the project. In this work, Wisnicki received key assistance from [qtip: Doug Emery|Doug Emery (Programmer, Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies, University of Pennsylvania). Data manager for the first phase of the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project; honorary team member of the second project phase.] (who continued to advise the project despite having formally left it) and was also aided by [qtip: Jessica Dussault|Jessica Dussault (Programmer/Analyst II, Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska-Lincoln).

<p>Finally, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and, separately, Wisnicki and [qtip: Banks|Nigel Banks (Independent programmer). Lead developer for the critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts.] turned to development of the interface. Ward, working with Wisnicki, first converted all critical materials to Drupal while embedding them in the <em>Livingstone Online</em> site. Wisnicki then selected and added all illustrative materials, with an eye to highlighting the complex, intercultural legacy of Livingstone’s 1870-71 manuscripts from the nineteenth century to the present day. The illustrative images included many created by [qtip: Angela Aliff|Angela Aliff (Graduate Student, Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Research assistant and interface designer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] for the <em>Livingstone Online</em> project as a whole. Once the scholars had finalized individual webpages, [qtip: Lauren Geiger|Lauren Geiger (Graduate Student, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Research assistant for the critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts.], another of Wisnicki’s graduate research assistants, conducted a final review of each page.</p>

<p>Through detailed discussion, Wisnicki also collaborated with Banks on planning the technical creation of the edition in Islandora. The subsequent development, led by Banks, entailed creating a special content type to accommodate critical editions within <em>Livingstone Online</em>, implementing a spectral image content model on the back end of the site, and enabling the batch uploading and replacing of spectral image files.</p>

<p>Banks also built a dynamic image viewer for <em>Livingstone Online</em>, then enhanced this viewer to facilitate user review of multiple spectral images for each page of the manuscript. As a last step, Banks created a Drupal page that would enable <a href="/spectral-imaging/three-versions-1870-field-diary">comparative study</a> of encoded versions of the 1870 Field Diary and the corresponding segments of the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), and the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874).</p>

<p>Thanks to these efforts over the three-year period of the grant, the beta version of the critical edition of Livingstone’s 1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 was released by the project team on 16 November 2016. To mark the release, US-based members of the team traveled to the UK to meet with UK-based collaborators and to deliver a series of presentations on the project at stakeholder institutions. These included lectures at the University of Edinburgh (14 November 2016), the University of Oxford (16 November 2016), and Queen\'s University Belfast (18 November 2016).</p>

<p>The beta release "tour" gave team members from alternate sides of the Atlantic a chance to review the project face-to-face, to discuss results with representatives from these institutions as well as the David Livingstone Centre, the National Library of Scotland, and the Royal Geographical Society, and, finally, to explore the possibility of applying advanced spectral image processing to other UK-based Livingstone manuscripts as well as objects collected during Livingstone’s travels. (Read the blog post on the "tour" <a href="https://livingstoneonline.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/a-new-multispectral-edition-of-the-1870-field-diary/" target="_blank">here</a>). During the tour, the team also planned for the release of the formal first edition of the project (which would include additional critical materials and would correct site bugs, typos, and other such minor issues) in early 2017.</p>

<p>The project to produce a multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1870 Field Diary lasted just over three years. Given the scale and complexity of the endeavor, the project ran exceptionally smoothly end-to-end. We attribute this to three factors. First, the commitment of our team members, which resulted in consistent, incremental development throughout the project’s life span. Second, Wisnicki and Ward\'s joint directorship brought different critical frameworks to the project that enriched the final edition. And finally, our project\'s multigenerational, interdisciplinary approach resulted in insights that could only emerge from scientists and literary critics, junior and senior scholars, working truly collaboratively.</p>

<p>In David Livingstone\'s overland expeditions in Africa, as in most nineteenth-century expeditions, science and medicine played a key role in geographic exploration. In fact, many expeditions deliberately set out to acquire new scientific knowledge. Yet it should also be remembered that from the earliest times, exploration was regarded as a key element in economic development, directly tied up with naval and military operations and trade. Whether on land or sea, early expeditions were usually sponsored by governments eager for territorial expansion or by private trading companies, such as the Dutch East India Company, which traded in spices, commercial goods, curiosities and medicinal substances. Any scientific or medical information brought back was highly valued.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century many famous expeditions were despatched from Europe. These were often explicitly colonising enterprises, particularly involving the annexation of various regions in South America, India, Australasia and the Pacific Ocean. Historians now acknowledge that these expeditions mostly appropriated local objects and information in order to enhance Western knowledge. There was little appreciation of indigenous culture, except as the source of romantic exoticism and things to be taken away for museums.</p>

<p>In North America, President Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark across the continent to collect information about the interior, then almost completely unknown to east coast inhabitants. Captain James Cook\'s two voyages to the “Antipodes” (1768-71 and 1772-1775) claimed Australia for the British crown while natural philosophers measured the astronomical movements of the planet Venus and collected many thousands of natural history specimens, including the first kangaroo skin to be seen in Europe.</p>

<p>By the nineteenth century, land and sea voyages were crucial in the territorial and political expansion of national powers: Britain, the continental European states, the United States, and Russia all sought to expand their influence. Admiral Bellinghausen of the Russian Imperial Navy explored the Antarctic in 1819-21, French naval expeditions led by Dumont D\'Urville moved across the Pacific Ocean, and many polar explorations were despatched northwards by the British Admiralty from 1816 to 1857 to locate what was reputed to be “the north-west passage,” a hypothetical open waterway between the great oceans.</p>

<p>African exploration was an important and fascinating part of this enterprise, although usually confined to coastal regions before the end of the nineteenth century. As the age of empire escalated, Africa became the focus of European countries seeking valuable trading possibilities and territory. The “scramble for Africa” around the years 1880 to 1940 saw rival nations fighting to divide the continent between them.</p>

<p>During the first half of the nineteenth century, academic societies and private associations also sponsored exploring expeditions, usually by selling financial shares in the enterprise. Geographical societies naturally wished to advance knowledge and make discoveries. Botanical gardens and horticultural societies might pay for individual plant collectors to join a pre-existing expedition. A wealthy individual like Sir Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society, 1778-1820) might even ask an employee to travel to Australia to collect privately for him.</p>

<p>Otherwise, natural history entrepreneurs generally financed their own expeditions by the sale of specimens on their return, as did Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates who explored the Amazon for natural history specimens in 1848-1852. Alexander von Humboldt travelled extensively in South and Central America, returning to Europe in 1804. The botanist Joseph Hooker explored inland India as far as Tibet during the late 1840s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Towards the end of the nineteenth century, as big science emerged and international scientific consolidation took place, large-scale scientific research expeditions were mounted, such as the deep sea work of the <em>Challenger</em> (1872-76), under Charles Wyville Thomson, and the South Pole explorations of the <em>Discovery</em> (1901-4) and <em>Terra Nova</em> (1910-12), under Captain Robert Falcon Scott. This type of expedition was expensive, highly organised and often took place on a co-operative international basis.</p>

<p>Expeditions consequently provide considerable insight into the social structure and theory-base of nineteenth-century science and natural history. Science was fast becoming an internationalised pursuit. Significant metropolitan centres like Berlin, London or Paris became crucial for processing the results of exploration. The old imperial idea of "centre and periphery," the centre being the place where information was converted into scientific "facts," suited scholars in developed countries very well and contributed materially to the specialisation of their disciplines.</p>

<p>In short, a wide variety of intellectual, financial, and bureaucratic structures should always be taken into account when analysing the knowledge produced by nineteenth-century expeditions. Much of the historical meaning of nineteenth-century travelling comes from this context of production.</p>

<p>The present design of the <em>Livingstone Online</em> website pays tribute to the project’s scholarly heritage and offers a multifaceted means of encountering Livingstone’s extensive manuscripts, along with materials related to his imperial Victorian contexts. The design is the result of <a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2016">LEAP</a>, a four-year project development initiative funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities that has enabled us to rethink our project interface. Our goal has been to facilitate content navigation while engaging diverse audiences and offering new perspectives on Livingstone’s iconographic legacy. This essay outlines the key components of the redesigned site, the site’s aesthetic objectives, and the collaborative process that led to the redesign.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> consists of five levels: 1) the home page, 2) the six section pages, 3) the content pages of each section, 4) our manuscript viewer, and 5) four digital collection browse and search pages. Users can drill down to metadata linked to our digital collection as well as specific secondary and primary content, such as critical essays or digital editions of original Livingstone manuscripts; or they can navigate laterally within similar types of content by, for instance, moving among essays within a particular section or by exploring different browse options. Additionally, uniform color coding among sections and the use of a carousel on content and browse pages helps orient users within the site.</p>

<p>Level 1 (homepage) features a slideshow of full-screen images that reflect the diversity of the site’s content. Rather than present the figure of Livingstone in isolation, these images highlight the many dimensions of his legacy by depicting both the disciplines in which he worked, such as geography, entomology, and zoology, and his relationships with non-western populations. Indeed, of the seven home page images, only two show Livingstone; in each case, he appears among an array of individuals linked to his travels.</p>

<p>Level 2 (section pages) divides the visual field into a series of tiles illustrated with images from Livingstone’s life and <em>Livingstone Online</em> project development activities. In the interactive desktop version of the site, users hover over the featured images to uncover titles and taglines describing linked content pages. In designing the tiles, we have juxtaposed heterogeneous sets of images, attempting to both represent and disrupt Livingstone’s iconic past. In addition, we hope the layout promotes individual meaning making as users assemble their own archive of information about Livingstone’s life and work.</p>

<p>Level 3 (content pages) presents a variety of critical essays about Livingstone’s life and times, documentary materials related to the <em>Livingstone Online</em> site and its development, and various other pieces linked to project team practices, collaborative relationships, and our outreach program. Users can explore pages individually or navigate the site content horizontally (via color-coded carousels and arrows at the sides of the screen) in order to identify relationships among pieces within a given section.</p>

<p>Level 4 (manuscript viewer) enables direct encounter with Livingstone’s written legacy through the provision of both high-resolution images and rigorously edited transcriptions of manuscripts with relevant metadata. All supporting icons and functions are contained in a single strip at the top of the screen, allowing maximum screen space for interacting with the manuscripts themselves and thereby mimicking the real-life encounter with Livingstone’s manuscript in a museum or archive. Users can “handle” the manuscript via zooming, rotation, and page selection or share individual manuscript pages via email or through a selection of social media formats such as Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.</p>

<p>Finally, Level 5 (browse and search pages, “In His Own Words” section only) presents a variety of ways to find specific items in our digital collection. Users can search collection items by <a href="/browse/addressee">addressee</a>, <a href="/his-own-words/repository">repository</a>, or <a href="/his-own-words/timeline">timeline</a>, or browse our extensive <a href="/islandora/search">digital catalogue</a> of nearly 3,000 Livingstone and Livingstone-related item records. Our goal in providing these options is to cater to diverse audience needs and expectations, while also offering multiple paths into our collection and highlighting the many connections that exist among different Livingstone manuscripts.</p>

<p><em>Livingstone Online</em> cuts against stereotypical representations of the Victorians as stiff or prudish by mixing a dynamic array of images – modern and historical – to provide a fresh look at the Victorian era and one of its most iconic explorers, David Livingstone.</p>

<p>The site achieves this objective by drawing on thousands of illustrative and manuscript images from over <a href="/behind-scenes/collaborating-institutions">40 archives around the world</a>. In combination, the images dispel the idea of a monolithic Livingstone, destined for a heroic legacy of exploration and discovery. Instead, the images complement the complexity and richness of Livingstone’s world and his words. The images also foreground the many individuals, processes, and technologies involved in the preservation of Livingstone’s legacy over time, particularly in the present digital age.</p>

<p>Led by <em>Livingstone Online</em> user interface designer Angela Aliff, our design team included director Adrian S. Wisnicki, associate director Megan Ward, and research assistants Ashanka Kumari and Erin Cheatham. Though we came to <em>Livingstone Online</em> as literary scholars, we quickly immersed ourselves in the world of web design, working in three phases.</p>

<p>The initial design phase began with a review of academic archives that shared our vision for featuring manuscripts alongside their transcriptions, such as the <a href="http://www.edickinson.org/" target="_blank">Emily Dickinson</a> and <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/" target="_blank">Shelley-Godwin</a> archives. These sites provided ideas for coupling visible, intuitive image manipulation tools with maximum screen space for manuscript images. Additionally, sites such as the <a href="http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/" target="_blank">Wilson Center Digital Archive</a> and the <a href="http://digital.library.ucla.edu/aqueduct/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Aqueduct Digital Platform</a> offered models for representing data along the vectors of space and time.</p>

<p>In the next design phase, we sought to find example sites that would enable us to feature and highlight the hundreds of illustrations found in the <em>Livingstone Online</em> digital collection. We realized that our access to such images distinguished our project among comparable academic sites. For inspiration, we turned to sites featuring commercial photography, whose goal is to drive traffic specifically by featuring images. We found ourselves, rather unexpectedly, drawn to wedding photography sites such as <a href="http://jasminestar.com/" target="_blank">Jasmine Star</a> and <a href="http://www.cast83.com/" target="_blank">Cast83</a>, whose simple yet appealing image presentation encouraged interactivity. Ultimately, the appeal of such sites led directly to the development of our Level 2 image site pages.</p>

<p class="space1" style="line-height:110%"><a href="/sites/default/files/about-this-site/the-design-livingstone-online/IMG_7234-2-article.jpg"><img alt="View of the seacliffs towards Simon\'s Town from Cape Point, South Africa, 2013.

<p>In the final phase, we realized that while most photographers feature images rather than text, we would need to find ways to display text clearly and efficiently due to our plans to publish a variety of critical articles. As a result, we turned to content-heavy sites such as <a href="http://www.espn.com" target="_blank">ESPN</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, which offer users a plethora of navigation options and allow for specialized paths through an ever-changing array of content. We realized the relatively static nature of an academic site eliminated a number of complexities in information display, leading us to a deeper appreciation for the appealing minimalism of sites like <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout, we strove to enact the values underlying our new site design: simplicity, intuitiveness, and elegance. These qualities, we believe, make for a site that enriches at the visual level, encourages users to take part in information discovery, and ultimately fosters an ongoing encounter with and reflection on core data and critical content in the <em>Livingstone Online</em> digital library and museum.</p>

<p>As is well known, Livingstone was born into a poor, deeply religious family at Blantyre, near Glasgow, Scotland. After rudimentary schooling he worked in the town\'s cotton mill. What set him apart from an early age was his voracious appetite for reading and his interest in natural history, which was in many ways the premier science of nineteenth-century Britain. At the age of twenty-one, he simultaneously determined to become a missionary and decided that a medical training would be invaluable in carrying out this plan, an unusual combination so early in the century.</p>

<p>During the early nineteenth century, medical education was undergoing turbulent changes. University education was not then, as it is now, the most common route to qualification. University education usually resulted in an MD but practitioners of all sorts were called doctor by courtesy even though they did not have a medical degree. Livingstone was one such practitioner. Apprenticeship to an apothecary or a surgeon was one possible route to qualification in those years and was chosen by a large number of young men (medical qualifications could then be obtained only by men).</p>

<p>Most youths entering the profession in Britain were going to join the swelling ranks of general practitioners. These doctors were distinguished from the wealthier surgeons and physicians with large private practices and hospital posts who were beginning to call themselves consultants. Most general practitioners or military and naval doctors were educated by attending lectures at private medical schools or schools attached to the great hospitals and dispensaries, followed by bedside instruction in hospitals.</p>

<p>Classes were also given by teachers associated with some of the ancient medical corporations. These were the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons in London and Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.</p>

<p class="space-2">The surgical corporations, besides offering medical classes, were also examining and licensing bodies. A student properly equipped with certificates of attendance at the requisite number of recognised courses could present himself for examination at one these bodies and, if successful, could receive a licence to practise. The requirements of the corporations varied slightly but a student would normally attend the following classes:</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="max-width: 600px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>anatomy.</li>
				<li>physiology.</li>
				<li>chemistry.</li>
				<li><em>materia medica</em> (the study of drugs and their actions).</li>
				<li>the operations and principles of surgery.</li>
				<li>the theory of disease.</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The student would attend a hospital and follow two or more courses of clinical (bedside) instruction in surgery and medicine. Experience in midwifery and attendance at surgical operations were also required.</p>

<p>This was the educational route that Livingstone chose. He began studying medicine at Anderson\'s University Glasgow (also known as Andersonian University Glasgow), in 1836. Anderson\'s Institution was established in 1796 under the will of John Anderson. In 1828 its name was changed to Anderson\'s University. It was forced to change its name to Anderson\'s College in 1877 because it did not have a Royal Warrant. Its medical school had been established in 1800. It was a basic medical college and the student would need to go elsewhere to gain bedside experience and a licence to practise.</p>

<p>For a child from his background it is no exaggeration to say that Livingstone\'s attendance at Anderson\'s University was an extraordinary achievement. Every Monday in term time he walked the eight miles to Glasgow where he had lodgings. During vacations he worked at the mill. At Anderson\'s, Livingstone took the anatomy course which ran from 1 November 1836 to 25 April 1837. This was a series of lectures, possibly enlivened by the display of wax models and injected preparations.</p>

<p>In the same academic year he also took the course in practical anatomy. In this course he would have observed dissection and almost certainly dissected human corpses for himself. Livingstone retook the course of lectures in anatomy in 1838-1839. This was not because he had failed – there were no examinations – since his authenticated certificate for 1836-1837 survives. Ambitious students often took courses twice in order to improve their knowledge.</p>

<p>All the anatomy classes were given by Robert Hunter, an MD, who, in 1840, was on the local committee of the Phrenological Association. Nowhere does Livingstone give any indication of the slightest interest in phrenology, a pursuit at this time often accused of irreligious tendencies. Also in 1836-1837, Livingstone took the course in chemistry given by Thomas Graham.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s second year was quite energetic. Besides hearing the anatomy course for the second time, he attended lectures on surgery given by James Adair Lawrie MD who, in 1850, succeeded to the chair of surgery at the Glasgow School of Medicine. Livingstone would learn practical surgery in London. He took two courses in chemistry given by William Graham, one simply called "Chemistry" (a lecture course) and practical chemistry.</p>

<p>He also attended Andrew Buchanan\'s lectures on materia medica. Andrew Buchanan, is said by Livingstone\'s biographer William Blaikie to have been Professor of the Institutes of Medicine (now called physiology), and Livingstone probably attended a course of that name but no certificate has been found.</p>

<p>During his two years at Anderson\'s and, subsequently, his time in London, Livingstone became well acquainted with a number of important figures in science and medicine whose patronage surely helped him in later life. According to Blaikie he enjoyed Graham\'s lectures, and from James Young, Graham\'s assistant, Livingstone gained "a knowledge of tools," by which he meant practical experience with scientific instruments and equipment. Young, who later made a fortune out of "Paraffin" and was one of Livingstone\'s trustees, assisted Livingstone financially after 1857. He was "attracted" too by the teaching of Andrew Buchanan with whom he remained a "life-long and much-attached friend." One of Livingstone\'s classmates was Lyon Playfair, later Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh and eventually Baron Playfair. He also met the brothers James Thomson and William Thomson, both of whom were to have outstanding scientific careers.</p>

<p>At the same time as Livingstone studied the basic medical subjects he took classes in Greek (he already knew Latin) and attended theology lectures. After two years at Anderson\'s he was accepted on probation by the London Missionary Society and he was sent to Chipping Ongar in Essex where his medical studies were temporarily suspended for tuition in Greek, Latin, Hebrew and theology.</p>

<p>In January 1840 he moved to a boarding house for young missionaries in Aldersgate, London. He then attended medical classes and learned clinical skills at the British and Foreign Medical School, the Aldersgate Street Dispensary, Charing Cross Hospital and Moorfields Hospital (an ophthalmic hospital). He also attended the lectures of the comparative anatomist Richard Owen at the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Livingstone wrote Owen at least eight letters.</p>

<p>Two of these letters (Livingstone 1841; Livingstone 1865) are available on <em>Livingstone Online</em>. The letter of 1841 is especially interesting since it concerns the collection of scientific specimens during his travels. At Charing Cross Hospital Livingstone was taught medicine by James Risdon Bennett to whom Livingstone wrote at least four letters in the 1840s. Bennett was a distinguished London physician. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and became President of the Royal College of Physicians of England in 1876 and was knighted in 1881. Bennett put down his recollections of Livingstone for William Blaikie, one of Livingstone\'s first biographers.</p>

<p>The only evidence of Livingstone\'s medical education in this period is a letter from Risdon Bennett testifying that David attended Bennett\'s lectures on the theory and practice of medicine, 1839-1840. In London Livingstone also met George Wilson through Thomas Graham, who by now had moved to become Professor of Medicine at University College. Wilson became Professor of Technology at the University of Edinburgh and first Director of the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art. In November 1840, after examination, Livingstone became a Licentiate of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.</p>

<p>On this occasion Livingstone swore an oath which is very loosely based on the Hippocratic Oath, but much is omitted from the ancient document and other things added (for example, Livingstone swears by "God" not "Apollo"). Livingstone\'s version of this oath, in his own hand, is almost an exact transcription of the words which were printed in a booklet, <em>The Royal Charter and Laws of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, June 5, 1821</em> (Glasgow, R. Chapman, 1821). On 8 December 1840, a qualified practitioner, Livingstone set sail for Cape Town.</p>

<p>Livingstone’s medical education encouraged prospective doctors to think about health and illness on the widest of canvases. This had been an integral part of western medicine since antiquity. One of the most revered works of the writings attributed to Hippocrates and included in the so-called Hippocratic Corpus was “Airs, waters and places.” In modern language this was a study of the geography, geology, meteorology and anthropology of the Mediterranean region. It was a compilation of observations of the peoples of the area, the diseases to which they were susceptible and the climates and environments likely to be conducive to health.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s letters are steeped in this tradition. He repeatedly recorded his medical observations of the tribes of Africa, whether a region was salubrious or not, and so on. Retrospectively these observations can be designated geological, meteorological, natural historical and so forth. In fact, for Livingstone, they were also medical. Taken together, we can see these observations also imagining the possibilities for colonization. Livingstone was interested every aspect of an area in order to discover whether it was suitable for European settlement or likely to produce insurmountable poor consequences for health. As a result, Livingstone’s medical education influenced his life as a missionary, explorer, and writer.</p>

<p>Field Diary XV begins before the previous field diary (<a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-xiv-overview">XIV</a>) ends, while Livingstone is still in Unyanyembe. The two diaries cover about two months of the same time period, July-September 1872. It is not clear why Livingstone kept two diaries, though Field Diary XV contains longer narrative passages. During this time, Livingstone waits for his men to return from guiding Stanley to the coast and then finally leaves Unyanyembe on 25 August 1872, heading west to Lake Tanganyika. From there, he and his men travel south around the lake.</p>

<p>Livingstone uses Field Diary XV to expand on his brief descriptions in <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-xiv-overview">Field Diary XIV</a> of the local conflicts raging in the region. He reports that the Africans, comprising several different groups headed by chief Mirambo, have challenged the Arabs, who in turn have hired some of the Watuta people to fight for them, as well as calling for more Arab men, though the latter never arrived. Together, these circumstances leave "all trade at a standstill" (Livingstone 1872g:[15]).</p>

<p>Though Livingstone does not explore the reasons for the conflict, it seems to be in response to the Arab treatment of Africans; the hiring of the Watuta, however, complicates the strict African / Arab divide. In addition, the Arabs bring in a cannon, which epitomizes the layers of imperial conflict being enacted on this site; it\'s "a brass seven pounder dated 1679 carried by the Portuguese commander in chief to China" (Livingstone 1872g:[6]).</p>

<p>As in <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-xiv-overview">Field Diary XIV</a>, we see Livingstone engaging in renewed communications outside of Africa. The upside-down section at the back of the diary does not act as notes to be expanded upon in the front but rather contains several long screeds on Livingstone\'s standing with the Foreign Office based on reports by Dr. Kirk. Though Kirk apparently reported "that he had sent off supplies &amp; men," Livingstone counters that these are only "half truths" because Kirk handed the supplies off to a group of slavers who did not complete the delivery (Livingstone 1872g:[118]).</p>

<p>This disagreement leads Livingstone to contemplate his career and to make many more philosophic and religious statements about empire than he usually includes in his field notes. For instance, he sees the disagreement with Kirk as "nothing less than the maintenance of British European influence to carry out the great work of civilization which Providence in its wisdom has entrusted to our nation" (Livingstone 1872g:[118]). Many of these statements are written either in black ink or ink over pencil, suggesting that Livingstone was particularly invested in the longevity of these reports.</p>

<p>In between these records of local conflict and far-flung politics, Livingstone documents botanical, meteorological, and geological information. He also mentions an earthquake on 16 August 1872 and includes many lists of goods, some of them allied with names of specific people. As has now become common, many of Livingstone\'s entries record his struggles to obtain sufficient food and to deal with illness in himself and his men.</p>

<p>Field Diary XV also presents a new kind of book, this one bound in black, with a spine at the top and a metal clasp at the bottom. It measures 157 mm high by 92 mm wide by 17 mm high, with an 1868 calendar on the rear endpaper. The final page of the book also includes a list of months written in transliterated Arabic, including Ramadan for that year.</p>

Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] first took interest in the manuscript of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary while researching a book chapter on Victorian travel to Nyangwe, the village in which Livingstone wrote most of the diary. The Livingstone<em> Catalogue of Documents</em> (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979) placed the manuscript in the John Murray Archive in London, but further enquiries revealed that the <a href="http://www.nls.uk/" target="_blank">National Library of Scotland</a> (NLS), which now owns the <a href="http://digital.nls.uk/jma/" target="_blank">Murray Archive</a>, had only low-quality photocopies of the manuscript made in the 1970s.</p>

<p>The <em>Catalogue</em> also noted that the museum based at Livingstone’s childhood home in Blantyre, the <a href="http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/David-Livingstone-Centre/" target="_blank">Scottish National Memorial to David Livingstone</a> (also known as the <a href="http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/David-Livingstone-Centre/" target="_blank">David Livingstone Centre</a> [DLC]), had previously owned the manuscript. As a result, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] next visited the DLC in June 2009 and – thanks to the efforts of [qtip:Anne Martin|Anne Martin (David Livingstone Centre). Institutional contact for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], volunteer archivist at the DLC – located the second half of the manuscript, those pages held under DLC identifier 297b. The whereabouts of the remaining pages remained a mystery. Wisnicki also discovered that the manuscript was illegible, with only some 15% of Livingstone’s text being visible. Livingstone\'s improvised ink had faded, while the newsprint over which he had written remained prominent, thereby obscuring the handwritten text. Despite these issues, Wisnicki had a hunch that the text could be recovered.</p>

The email caught the attention of Will Noel, then Curator of Manuscripts at the <a href="https://thewalters.org/" target="_blank">Walters Art Museum</a> in Baltimore, Maryland. Noel forwarded Wisnicki’s email to the <a href="http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/" target="_blank">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> spectral imaging team who then contacted Wisnicki. The Archimedes imaging team took interest in the diary because it offered the opportunity to apply spectral imaging and processing techniques developed to study older, parchment-based palimpsests to a more modern, paper-based document. Christopher Lawrence, then director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, encouraged such a collaborative project and offered to publish the results through his site.</p>

<p>As a result, two representatives of the Archimedes imaging team, program manager [qtip:Michael B. Toth|Michael B. Toth (R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] and data manager [qtip:Doug Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], joined [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], [qtip:Debbie Harrison|Debbie Harrison (Birkbeck, University of London). Contributing editor and outreach director for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] (medical humanities specialist and Wisnicki’s colleague at Birkbeck College), and Sharon Messenger (then research assistant at Livingstone Online) in visiting the DLC in mid October 2009. The group met with representatives of the DLC, including trustees, staff, and representatives from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), to discuss the project and view the manuscript.</p>

<p>The group took a small sample of the laminate used on the manuscript leaves for assessment at the U.S. Library of Congress and comparison with other spectrally imaged laminated documents. The group also collected some sample spectral images of a few leaves to validate the potential of spectral imaging to reveal Livingstone’s text. They collected the images in a darkened room by using a small 5 MegaPixel color camera taped to an overhead projector arm and a handheld light source with UV, red, green, yellow and blue lights.</p>

Contributing editor and outreach director for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] (London), and the Archimedes imaging team (Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, Maryland; Rochester, New York; Maui, Hawaii) resulted in extensive follow-up discussion by telephone, Skype, and email regarding a possible collaboration. The group also decided to apply to the U.S. <a href="https://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> (NEH) for a Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant. Mike Phelps, Executive Director of the <a href="http://emelibrary.org" target="_blank">Early Manuscripts Electronic Library</a>, offered to have his organization serve as the grantee organization and himself as administrator, and the team submitted a formal application to the NEH on 6 October 2009. The team also submitted an application to the <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/" target="_blank">British Academy</a> for a Small Research Grant on 20 February 2010.</p>

<p>During late 2009 and early 2010, [qtip:Martin|Anne Martin (David Livingstone Centre). Institutional contact for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] continued her efforts at the DLC in locating the remaining pages of the 1871 Field Diary. The pages had not been catalogued properly, but Martin’s perseverance resulted not only in the rediscovery of the missing pages (those now under DLC identifier 297c) but also in the recovery of several pages of Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870 Field Diary</a>, which she and [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] had not been able to locate during Wisnicki’s initial visit to Blantyre in June 2009 (the pages now under 297d and 297e).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Livingstone’s Letter from Bambarre.</strong> Simultaneously, in late 2009 Elizabeth Upper, a graduate student of Cambridge University, contacted Livingstone Online on behalf of Peter Beard, the American photographer. Beard and his wife Nejma offered to make available for study a previously unpublished Livingstone letter from their personal collection in New York City. By a striking coincidence, Livingstone had composed this letter during the same period as the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries, using the same improvised techniques.</p>

<p>More fortuitously still, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], who was then a research consultant for Livingstone Online, had himself just moved to New York City and was residing a mere 8 miles away from the letter. Wisnicki visited the <a href="http://peterbeard.com/" target="_blank">Peter Beard Studio</a> to view the letter and eventually arranged for its transport to the Walters Art Museum, where the letter was spectrally imaged in early 2010 during a separately funded palimpsest imaging project. On 2 July 2010, the team formally announced the start up of <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">The David Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> with the publication of this letter in a multispectral critical edition as <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Livingstone\'s Letter from Bambarre</a>. That edition then became the prototype and template for the current critical edition.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Setting the Stage.</strong> The U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) formally awarded the Livingstone team a Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant on 11 March 2010. The team’s grant application set the start date as 1 May 2010. Planning for the project began with the drafting of the grant application, but serious plans could not go forward until this grant announcement.</p>

<p>The team decided to travel to Scotland for the spectral imaging of Livingstone’s manuscript in mid-June 2010. This travel date necessitated that preparations begin from the moment of the announcement. The trustees of the David Livingstone Centre (DLC) had given the team preliminary permission for the project, but full written permission had now to be secured. A conservator would have to examine the manuscript and prepare it for imaging. The team had to select a site for the spectral imaging that met the technical requirements of the project. Finally, the team also needed to prepare a detailed imaging plan that included a Statement of Work (SOW) agreed on by all stakeholders, conduct a site survey, and secure the support of appropriate local personnel.</p>

<p class="space2">After discussion with the DLC staff, the Livingstone team decided to carry out the imaging at a second site. The National Library of Scotland (NLS), being located an hour by car from the DLC, offered the perfect alternative. [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] had previously discussed the project with [qtip:Alison Metcalfe|Alison Metcalfe (National Library of Scotland). Institutional contact for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], Manuscripts Curator at the National Library of Scotland (NLS), and together Wisnicki and Metcalfe now formalized the role of the NLS as a project partner. There were several advantages to this relationship. The library could provide the facilities and personnel needed to adequately support the project, and the library holds the largest number of Livingstone materials in the world. Should the imaging run ahead of schedule, Livingstone materials from the NLS could be spectrally imaged without added cost.<a id="link8" name="link8"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Permission and Conservation.</strong> With the location secured, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] now wrote letters to the DLC trustees and the Livingstone family for permission to transport, spectrally image, and digitally publish the relevant materials from the DLC and related materials at the NLS. Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson and Ian Livingstone proved to be very enthusiastic about the project and kindly granted permission on behalf of, respectively, the Livingstone family and the DLC trustees.</p>

<p>The National Trust for Scotland, in turn, arranged for Helen Creasy, Paper and Photograph Conservator at the Scottish Conservation Studio, to prepare the DLC materials for imaging, an activity covered by the team’s NEH grant. Creasy’s work included stabilizing documents for handling, repairing all edge tears and tears along central fold lines, reattaching a detached page, and supporting manuscript weaknesses using very light-weight Japanese tissue and wheat starch paste. She also photographed the documents before and after treatment, and secured and packed them for transportation. Kate Kidd, conservator at the NLS, evaluated the related NLS materials and found that they needed only minimal conservation, which the NLS provided pro bono.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Project Planning.</strong> Project planning took up the majority of time prior to the team’s departure for Scotland.

Toth’s work included developing a detailed imaging plan that outlined 1) an Assessment and Pilot Phase, 2) a Planning Phase, 3) an Imaging and Processing Phase, and 4) a Data Management Phase. Toth broke up each of these phases into discrete tasks, determined how many days would be required for each, and allocated work accordingly. Toth also prepared a series of documents for team members that foregrounded the relationships between the different tasks.</p>

<p>Alongside this work, [qtip:Toth|Michael B. Toth (R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] explored available imaging options. He circulated documents that detailed imaging schedule and on-site processing possibilities, and that highlighted potential issues. A follow-up imaging draft plan enumerated the specific pages to be imaged, proposed a day-by-day imaging schedule, and sketched a data delivery schedule. Toth also used email, phone calls, and teleconferences to coordinate activities between NLS staff, team members traveling from the U.S. to Scotland ([qtip:Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], [qtip:Bill Christens-Barry|Bill Christens-Barry (Equipoise Imaging, LLC).

<p>[qtip:Toth|Michael B. Toth (R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] developed this document in close collaboration with [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] and representatives of the NLS. The drafting process served to introduce NLS staff to the rubrics of multispectral imaging and underscored key requirements of the Livingstone team in Scotland, including the need to recruit and train local personnel for basic operation of the imaging system.</p>

<p>Just prior to departure, Toth developed a plan for transporting equipment to Scotland, and created a site survey checklist for team members who intended to visit the NLS in advance of the imaging sessions. In addition, days before the team left, the British Academy announced that it had awarded the team a Small Research Grant, which provided both for an enhanced site survey and helped defray other travel costs.</p>

<p>Spectral imaging, when used for the study of cultural objects, involves illuminating an object with successive wavelengths of light – starting with ultraviolet, working through the visible spectrum, and concluding with infrared – then digitally photographing the resulting illuminations. The produced images all have exactly the same pixel dimensions, and are spatially registered, the content being equivalent at each pixel location in each image. Later, imaging scientists process this data in order to enhance select features of the cultural object.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Imaging Set-Up.</strong> The Livingstone team spectrally imaged the 1871 Field Diary in the Reprographics Studio at the National Library of Scotland (NLS). The NLS could only allocate about half of the Studio to the team due to the need to support other ongoing activities. As a result, the team created a dark room by purchasing window curtain "blackout" lining at a local store and then hanging this curtain over the opening between the two halves of the Reprographics Studio, an expedient that worked surprisingly well. The NLS also provided the copy stand upon which all Livingstone folia were placed for imaging, tripods for the lighting system, a computer monitor for the camera system, and two workstations for the individuals operating the camera system and data logger.</p>

<p>The components transported by the team to Edinburgh included:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px">1) monochrome MegaVision E6 39 megapixel camera back (7216 X 5412 pixels; 16-bit data with approximately 12 bits of dynamic range) mounted in a technical view camera with a 60mm UV-VIS-IR lens and a color filter wheel installed for UV fluorescence studies.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px">2) light-emitting diode (LED) illumination panels which were placed on tripods on either side of the copy stand in symmetric downward-looking positions angled approximately 45º on either side. The team also used diffusers to create uniform and nondirectional light fields. Raking illumination was provided in two spectral bands from either side of the manuscript.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px">3) modified desktop computer that controlled the imaging system using MegaVision’s PhotoShoot™ 4.0 software. This software orchestrated the operation of both camera and lighting through FireWire and USB connections, respectively.</p>

<p>Each LED panel contains seven banks of LEDs that emit in the ultraviolet (1 wavelength) and visible regions (6 wavelengths) of the spectrum and five additional clusters of LEDs that emit in the infrared region (5 wavelengths). The geometry of the LED light panels is designed to provide maximum uniformity of the illumination at the surface of a leaf being imaged. A primary advantage of the system is that LEDs do not generate heat that can damage fragile pages. In addition, illumination from a low “raking” angle enhances the visibility of surface height variation, yielding images in which impressions or surface relief features are enhanced.</p>

<p>The EurekaVision™ system illuminated each Livingstone folio with twelve bands of wavelengths of light from the ultraviolet (UV) through the visible and the infrared (IR):</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="display:inline-block; text-align:left"><strong>Band = Wavelength in nanometers</strong><br />
01 = 365 (UV)<br />
02 = 450<br />
03 = 465<br />
04 = 505<br />
05 = 535<br />
06 = 592<br />
07 = 638<br />
08 = 700 (near IR)<br />
09 = 735 (near IR)<br />
10 = 780 (near IR)<br />
11 = 850 (near IR)<br />
12 = 940 (near IR)</span></p>

<p>The monochrome camera automatically photographed the folio under each illumination, with the raw image data stored on an external hard drive attached to the desktop computer. In addition, the team used four raking lights (lights that illuminate the folia at an oblique angle and so highlight page topography) mounted within separate panels and on separate tripods when imaging folia that had not been laminated, as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="display:inline-block; text-align:left"><strong>Band = Wavelength in nanometers</strong><br />
13 = 940RR (IR raking right)<br />
14 = 465RR (blue raking right)<br />
15 = 940RL (IR raking left)<br />
16 = 465RL (blue raking left)</span></p>

<p>The team chose to use a monochrome camera, without color or infrared filters, because doing so allows: 1) lower light levels for illumination, 2) no interpolation or preprocessing of the filtered image, minimizing collection artifacts, and 3) unfiltered light from all spectral bands to reach the camera sensor. Such a camera yields very pure, high-resolution, registered images of each spectral band and facilitates processing not only for text enhancement, but also for very accurate color reproduction.</p>

<p>To ensure the team captured accurate metadata about the objects and images, data manager [qtip:Doug Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] developed the Multispectral Imaging Metadata Machine, or MSIMM (pronounced "Miss M."), which powered data logging. As each document came up for imaging, the data logger located the document in the MSIMM database and read off the file name to the system operator who entered it into MegaVision’s PhotoShoot™. The data logger, in turn, noted any unusual features of the document or exceptional imaging circumstances (such as a reshoot due to previous interruptions) in the log. Once data had been entered, all personnel put on UV protective glasses, turned off the room lights, and the capture of the image set began. Each capture lasted about two minutes, with times slightly extended when raking lights were used. During capture no one could pass through the dark room because the data could be compromised and because individuals without appropriate eye protection could be injured by UV light.</p>

<p class="space2">The desktop computer powering the imaging system also collected the raw image data to an external hard drive. For each image, the system produced an image set of either twelve registered images or sixteen if the raking lights were used. Periodically, team members replaced the hard drive containing the raw data and took it away for copying, a task which constituted a full-time job in itself. Team members copied the raw data to other external hard drives brought by the team and transferred files externally via FTP overnight to a designated site. This distribution strategy helped prevent the loss of data and made the data available to scientists onsite ([qtip:Easton|Roger L. Easton, Jr. (Rochester Institute of Technology). Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.], [qtip:Christens-Barry|Bill Christens-Barry (Equipoise Imaging, LLC).

Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.]) for validation, assessment, and initial processing. The strategy also enabled [qtip:Emery|Doug Emery (Emery IT). Data manager for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] to review the data and metadata for quality and provide updates to the metadata records and software. As a result, the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone-spectral-imaging-project-introduction">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> was able to operate twenty-four hours a day during this period.<a id="link13" name="link13"></a></p>

<p class="space2">During the sessions, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Indiana University of Pennsylvania). Director, lead scholar, and principal writer for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] also took a day off (30 June) to travel up to Aberdeen where he met with historian Roy Bridges. Professor Bridges’s pioneering studies of the manuscripts of Victorian explorers of Africa – Livingstone in particular – had provided one of the key inspirations for Wisnicki to take forward his work on the diary. The visit allowed Wisnicki to meet Professor Bridges and describe the objectives of the spectral imaging project. Professor Bridges, in turn, furnished Wisnicki with a number of articles and other items – many of them unpublished – that would be useful to Wisnicki’s research on the 1871 Field Diary.<a id="link14" name="link14"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Imaging Schedule and Objectives.</strong> In planning for the spectral imaging sessions, the team allowed for two different scenarios. Imaging the DLC folia under the identifiers 297b and 297c (Livingstone 1871f), the core of the 1871 Field Diary, would take up the whole time in the worst-case scenario. Livingstone had used his improvised red ink on these folia. The newspaper pages over which he wrote had deteriorated over time. The pages had been laminated with a heat-set document repair tissue, a factor that compromised legibility and had the potential to impede spectral imaging and processing. Finally, the average page size (10 x 12 inches) suggested that each would have to be imaged in two segments and imaging time would be doubled if the imaging conditions at the NLS were not ideal.</p>

<p>None of these issues would emerge in the best-case scenario. Imaging of the 297b and 297c (Livingstone 1871f) folia would proceed smoothly, without any compromise in quality, and the team would have time to image at least a portion of the additional manuscript pages. There was reason to hope for this scenario. The team had collected a small sample of the laminate on 297b and 297c (Livingstone 1871f) in October 2009. Subsequent comparative analysis by Fenella France, Research Chemist at the U.S. Library of Congress (LoC), using another sample at the LoC with a known spectral response helped the team understand some focus issues associated with imaging laminated documents. In addition, [qtip:Easton|Roger L. Easton, Jr. (Rochester Institute of Technology). Imaging scientist for the multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s 1871 Field Diary.] had processed some of the low-resolution, unregistered spectral images collected in October 2009, and the results were promising. Finally, in Scotland the team could also draw on the experience of working with the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, the team balanced the schedule and cost risks and set their sights on the best-case scenario, a highly desirable outcome given the effort and expense involved in coordinating schedules, securing permissions, arranging facilities, and bringing equipment and personnel to Scotland. As a test run, the team spent most of the first imaging session (24 June) on letters and diary pages composed with the same materials as the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a> or with the same ink as the 1871 Field Diary. The experiment proved a full success, with no issues coming into play, so on the second day, a Saturday, the team moved to the 297b and 297c (Livingstone 1871f) folia. Again, none of the anticipated issues arose, and the team not only completed the entire run of these folia, but also those of DLC297e. This development put the team five days ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>The team moved to additional DLC and NLS pages in the following days. By capturing these images, the team ultimately doubled its anticipated results and laid the groundwork for the next phase of the project, a multispectral critical edition of Livingstone\'s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870 Field Diary and select 1870-71 manuscripts</a>, at no added cost. In fact, the team ran so far ahead of schedule that they concluded the imaging sessions by spectrally imaging a number of sample manuscript folia at the request of the NLS. These included two folia from a Gaelic 1467 manuscript by Dubhghall Albanach mac mhic Cathail (file prefix MS. 72.1.1), a few letters from Lord Byron (MS. 43325, MS. 43327, and MS. 43408), and the entire text of Sir John Franklin’s 1821 Field Diary (MS. 42237).</p>

        'value' => '<p>Until the 1970s, no one knew the full extent of Livingstone’s surviving manuscripts. A number of particularly well known libraries and archives in Britain and Africa had substantial holdings of original Livingstone manuscripts. In addition, a handful of collections of letters and other items had emerged over the years, notably a series edited by Isaac Schapera, who focused on Livingstone’s writings from his first sojourn in Africa (1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1974). Some letters had also appeared in print in a variety of sources that went back to the nineteenth century. Yet Livingstone had been one of the most prolific travelers to visit nineteenth-century Africa. Anyone who took a serious interest in his legacy recognized the need for a full enumeration of his manuscripts.</p>

<p>The Livingstone Documentation Project (LDP) emerged to meet this need. Although LDP did not originate at a single moment, it first took substantial shape at a 1973 University of Edinburgh seminar marking the centenary of Livingstone’s death. At that seminar, scholars noted the need for a catalogue of all Livingstone manuscripts, the creation of a central collection of original and photocopied materials, and, over time, the publication of critically-edited collections. Work focusing on the first two objectives got underway in earnest over the next few years. The project’s efforts resulted, ultimately, in the monumental publication of <em>David Livingstone: A Catalogue of Documents</em> (1979) edited by Gary Clendennen and Ian Cunningham, followed by a supplement a few years later (Cunningham 1985) plus a history of the project (Clendennen and Casada 1981).</p>

<p>The <em>Catalogue</em> for the first time brought a number of key points to light. First, it confirmed that Livingstone had indeed been a prolific writer, probably more so than anyone had imagined. Second, it revealed that his original manuscripts as well as published versions of manuscripts that no longer survived still existed in vast abundance. The original <em>Catalogue</em> enumerated the following: over 2000 letters, 11 substantial journals, 39 field diaries of various sorts, 18 notebooks, 30 papers and reports, and almost 200 other miscellaneous items. Third, the <em>Catalogue</em> showed that these manuscripts were indeed scattered around the world, with some ninety repositories being listed between the <em>Catalogue</em> and its supplement that encompassed Britain, Portugal, France, New Zealand, the United States, and several countries in Africa. Many, many other items remained in unknown private hands. The project, which continued until April 1985, resulted in a significant portion of these manuscripts, either in original or copy, being brought together at the National Library of Scotland.</p>

<p>In 2004, <em>Livingstone Online</em> took up the work of the documentation project. Although <em>Livingstone Online</em> began with modest aims, each successive project stage enlarged the scope and objectives of the site. Between 2004 and 2013, the team of <em>Livingstone Online</em> acquired digital image copies (5000 image files) and/or created rigorous scholarly transcriptions of some 700 letters and and a variety of other items as well as multispectral editions of Livingstone’s <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870</a> and <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871</a> Field Diaries. The team also identified some thirty previously uncatalogued items, produced an integrated digital version of the original print <em>Catalogue</em> and its supplement, and acquired nearly 500 images of objects related to Livingstone’s travels or of repositories holding his manuscripts.</p>

<p>The <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project (LEAP, 2013-17) has further extended this work, collecting information on some 100 previously uncatalogued items, including maps, and adding 5000 new manuscript pages that cover all phases of Livingstone’s career. These encompass the surviving 850 page draft of <em>Missionary Travels</em> and nearly all the diaries, journals, notebooks, maps, and other items associated with Livingstone’s last travels (1866-73), possibly the most comprehensive and diverse surviving collection of manuscript documents related to any single nineteenth-century British expedition to Africa. Various site features and enhancements, detailed elsewhere on our site, enable interaction with and comparative study of these manuscripts in a manner never before possible.</p>

<p>As a result, today <em>Livingstone Online</em> provides unprecedented global access to a significant portion of Livingstone’s manuscript legacy. Through partnerships with the University of Maryland Libraries (our publisher) as well as the David Livingstone Centre, the National Library of Scotland, and other archives with Livingstone holdings, our site seeks to introduce a new generation of audiences with diverse interests to this legacy. And there is still much room to grow – including further multispectral study of particular documents and the addition of many, many still-undigitized manuscripts. In addition, initiatives left undone by the original documentation project are yet to be developed: the full enumeration of Livingstone’s surviving maps and the ever-alluring search for previously unknown Livingstone manuscripts in Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, and elsewhere around the world.

<p>Our critical edition of Livingstone\'s final manuscripts includes three bonus texts: a two-page fragment of Field Diary XII, the full text of the second Unyanyembe Journal, and two pages notes and calculations for Field Diary XVII. Our project team has critically encoded and edited each of these texts because they complement the main texts encoded for our edition, the <a href="/his-own-words/unyanyembe-journal-overview">Unyanyembe Journal</a> (1866-72) and <a href="/his-own-words/final-field-diaries-general-overview">twelve of the final field diaries</a> (1865-73). We see the bonus texts as representing, in miniature, Livingstone\'s composition process during his final travels because the texts encompass three distinct stages of production: notes for a field diary, part of a field diary, and a journal Livingstone wrote up based on one of his field diaries. Together, these documents offer a snapshot of the final manuscripts as a whole.</p>

<p>The bonus texts also illustrate some of the challenges in working with Livingstone’s final manuscripts. The distribution of the pages of Field Diary XII over two archives, one in the UK (<a href="/islandora/search/liv_000066?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue" target="_blank">two pages</a>, included here), the other in Zambia (<a href="/islandora/search/liv_000012" target="_blank">the rest of the diary</a>, not included), prevents integrated study. Comparison between the second Unyanyembe Journal and the field diary upon which it is based (<a href="/islandora/search/liv_000015?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue" target="_blank">Field Diary XV</a>) reveals factual discrepancies, despite the fact that Livingstone must have written the texts almost simultaneously. Finally, the fragmentary, decontextualized nature of the notes for Field Diary XVII impedes critical understanding of whether the notes embody a unique or regular stage in Livingstone\'s writing process during the last months of his life.</p>

After sailing around Lake Tanganyika to confirm that the lake had no connection to the Nile, Livingstone and Stanley left Ujiji (pictured at left [top in mobile]) and traveled to Unyanyembe where Livingstone parted with Stanley and entrusted the original Unyanyembe Journal (pictured at right [bottom]) to the latter.

<p>The fragment details a short period in Livingstone\'s travels as his party journeys in central Africa between Lakes Moero and Tanganyika en route to Ujiji. The fragment takes up topics that surface throughout the final field diaries. For instance, Livingstone complains of his inability to obtain food on Christmas day. He records rumors that have reached him in his present location by way of Ujiji. He reflects on and describes the country around him as he travels. Finally, he mentions the beating of a slave who tried to escape and notes his disagreement with some Arab traders as to the current day of the week, <a href="/spectral-imaging/date-livingstone-stanley-meeting">a problem that would resurface</a> when he came to write the 1871 Field Diary.</p>

<p>The fragment resides at the Wellcome Library in London and consists of a single leaf over which Livingstone has written in pencil on both sides. It appears that Anna Mary Wilson, Livingstone\'s youngest daughter, removed this leaf from the field diary and gifted it to Edith Kerr on 31 July 1886 (another insight into the preservation of Livingstone’s manuscripts initially as souvenirs rather than documents). The project team did not examine the rest of Field Diary XII, which resides at the Livingstone Museum in Zambia, but the shape and size of this leaf plus the documentation in the Livingstone <em>Catalogue</em> (Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:276) indicate that Livingstone used the same kind of flip-top Lett\'s notebook for this diary as he did for <a href="/islandora/search/liv_000014?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue" target="_blank">Field Diary XIV</a>. The fact that the entries here correspond to the final page of the first volume of the <em>Last Journals</em> (Livingstone 1874:358-60) may be of significance.</p>

<p>When Henry M. Stanley parted with Livingstone in March 1872, the former took away the original <a href="/islandora/search/liv_000019?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue" target="_blank">Unyanyembe Journal</a> (1866-72) for transport to Britain. Livingstone remained at Unyanyembe awaiting men and supplies that Stanley had promised to send. These arrived in August 1872, shortly before Livingstone began the second Unyanyembe Journal. This journal, therefore, opens with a short note from Stanley describing some of the ammunitions sent to Livingstone. The presence of the note suggests that Stanley sent the journal to Livingstone in the first place.</p>

<p>The rest of the journal (one page) consists of a series of dated entries that Livingstone has copied over from <a href="/islandora/search/liv_000014?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue" target="_blank">Field Diary XIV</a> (see Livingstone 1871n:[81]-[87]). In these entries, Livingstone describes his preparations for departing from Unyanyembe. He notes distributing his goods for transport among his men and records the challenge of getting additional carriers due to a local conflict. He also describes hearing of a remedy (that originates from India) for jungle fever.</p>

<p>The page closes with a reference to the misbehavior of a soldier. This misbehavior leads to violence with the headman Manna Sera and, finally, the following response from Livingstone: "[I] called all hands and made each give [the soldier] a beating - some were too gentle and I laid my stick on their backs" (1872i:[4]). The page thus captures elements of the circulation of knowledge in east Africa and routine facets of organized African travel, but also reveals how the associated violence could draw in or even be spurred on by explorers like Livingstone.</p>

<p>The second Unyanyembe Journal, like the first, is a large-size bound volume, although this second volume contains significantly fewer pages. The page of Stanley\'s text is in pencil, while the page of Livingstone\'s text contains entries in both brown and black ink, suggesting that the latter copied over his entries here in at least two installments. The volume also contains a single newspaper clipping in printed Chinese text. The project team has not translated the text of the clipping, and it is not clear who added it to the journal or under what circumstances. The remainder of the pages are blank and without distinguishing features (only a few sample blank pages have been imaged for the present edition).</p>

<p>That the entries end with Livingstone\'s departure from Unyanyembe and that the volume is in relatively pristine condition together suggest that Livingstone left this journal, along with the goods mentioned in the entry for 18 August&nbsp; (1872i:[4]), in Unyanyembe and planned to update it with further copied over field diary entries at some future date. The journal remained uncatalogued till it turned up at the David Livingstone Centre during preparations for <a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2017">LEAP</a>, the <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project, in the early 2010s.</p>

<p>Livingstone produced these notes and calculations in the final days of his life. The three dated entries detail the efforts of Livingstone and his party to traverse the marshes near the Monikazi River in the vicinity of Lake Bangweolo. The narrative captures the immense challenges the party faced during this period due to the inhospitable terrain: "went East &amp; lost our way in stiff grassy prairies which could scarcely be got through = in 5 hours" (1873a:[2]). The addition of two local guides fails to improve matters as the water remains "about 15 inches in spots and thigh deep in others." However, even amidst such troubles Livingstone still documents some of the local flora: "Papyrus arum = wild rice &amp; stiff grasses aquatic" (1873a:[2]).</p>

<span style="font-size:12px;">Notes and Calculations for Field Diary XVII, 7-9 April 1873 (Livingstone 1873a:[1]). <em>Copyright David Livingstone Centre. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a></em>. The printed text here includes part of an address that Roderick Murchison delivered to the Royal Geographical Society in 1870, as printed in a proof copy of the society\'s <em>Proceedings</em>. Two years earlier, Livingstone wrote the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre">Letter from Bambarre</a> and a handful of <a href="/islandora/search/letter?access=view_spectral&amp;f[]=repository_ms%3A&quot;National+Library+of+Scotland&quot;">other 1871 letters</a> over pages from another issue of the <em>Proceedings</em>.</span></p>

<p>The fragment consists of a single leaf. Livingstone has written wholly in pencil, over the recto and verso of a single page of a proof copy of the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</em> (cf. Murchison 1869-70:327-28). The underlying text is part of the annual address the Roderick Murchison delivered to the society on 23 May 1870. Elsewhere in the printed copy of this address Murchison discusses Livingstone\'s travels and notes that the latter has not been heard from in nearly a year (1869-70:329-31). The dating of the proof suggests that Stanley delivered it to Livingstone.</p>

<p>One side of the leaf (the side with the printed text) contains only Livingstone\'s calculations. The other side contains two columns of notes (chronologically, the first column is in the center, the second column at left) plus some more calculations. The narrative passages here reappear in considerably revised and expanded form in <a href="/islandora/search/liv_000017?access=all&amp;limit=catalogue" target="_blank">Field Diary XVII</a> (see 1873b:[9]-[13]).

<p>The survival of the 1870 Field Diary entailed the passage from the nineteenth century to the present, from central Africa to Britain, and from Livingstone’s hands through a variety of others’ to the present project team members’. These diverse journeys have left their marks on the diary’s pages and often serve as incidental witnesses, providing information about Livingstone’s practices as a traveler and writer, events in the life of the diary, and environments through which the diary passed and in which it was preserved. The application of spectral imaging technology to these aspects opens new dimensions in our understanding of such marks or makes us aware of them in the first place.</p>

<p>This section and the two that follow, therefore, concludes our analysis of the state of the diary manuscript by turning to material aspects of the diary closely linked to its travels across hands, space, and time. In this section, we consider characteristics related to composition of the diary, especially the diverse inks and pencil marks on the diary’s pages. In the next two sections, we examine handling of the diary, particularly as documented via folds, impressions, torn pages, and manuscript holes; and the impact of different environments on the diary’s pages as manifest through page discoloration and the presence of stains. We conclude with an additional section that sets out the diary’s previously documented history and that develops a new chronology of the manuscript (1863-2017) based on our overall study of its present state.</p>

<p>Livingstone constructed the 1870 Field Diary out of other texts over which he wrote his diary entries. These source texts divide into two categories: printed texts and handwritten texts. The 1870 Field Diary also includes a handful of additions in other hands made after the composition of the diary.</p>

<p class="space2">This subsection uses the presence of of various inks and pencil marks on the pages of the diary to describe how choices made by others in the first and third stages of composition of the text (i.e., those not involving Livingstone) helped configure the manuscript as it exists today. <a id="link4" name="link4"></a>This approach to reading the manuscript thus reconceptualizes the 1870 Field Diary as a multi-authored document and restores Livingstone’s work to a longer sequence of composition history.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Primary printed texts.</strong> The 1870 Field Diary includes five printed texts among its source materials: 1) the review essay from the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, April 1866 (Livingstone 1870b), 2) Arthur Penrhyn Stanley’s <em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em>, 1863 (Livingstone 1870e/1870f/1870i/1870j/1870k), 3) Samuel White Baker’s “A Map of the Albert N’yanza” from the <em>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</em>, 1866 (Livingstone 1870h) 4) the article (proof) by George Birdwood from the <em>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay</em>, 1863 (Livingstone 1871a/1871b), and 5) leaves from the <em>Pall Mall Budget</em>, 21 August 1869 (Livingstone 1871e).</p>

(Note: Our IC1 and IC3 spectral images foreground the printed texts for enhanced legibility, though the texts are generally visible beneath Livingstone’s writing. Alternate copies of nearly all of them are available at various research libraries.)</p>

<p class="space2">Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]), which appears on the verso of 1870h:XVII, XVIII, XIX, and XX, includes additional printed colors such as light blue for Lakes Albert and Victoria and red to indicate Baker’s route across the relevant part of north central Africa to Lake Albert.<a id="link5" name="link5"></a> Baker’s map is also the one printed text over which Livingstone has not actually written; instead, Livingstone has written all of his diary entries on the back of the map, with the exception of a minor set of calculations.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Primary handwritten texts.</strong>The 1870 Field Diary consists of two handwritten source texts in another hand: 1) the letter to Livingstone, July 1866, by someone named Gorbello[?] (Livingstone 1870c) and 2) the text that lies beneath 1870h:XVII – i.e., on one quadrant on the other side of Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]). As in the case of the printed texts, the ink used to create each handwritten document appears internally consistent in each document.</p>

<p>In terms of the Gorbello[?] letter, the original handwriting appears beneath pages 1870c:I and 1870c:IV of Livingstone’s diary and runs parallel to Livingstone’s text beneath 1870c:IV (the address) and perpendicular beneath 1870c:I (the letter itself). All of the handwriting appears to be in a brown ink similar to Livingstone’s own on 1870c:IV and indeed, given this similarity, the ink of this other handwriting may have a similar material composition. However, since our project does not include spectral images of the Gorbello[?] letter, the opportunity to engage in further study of the handwriting on this document is limited.</p>

<p>The handwritten text beneath page 1870h:XVII appears to be that of John Kirk, Political Agent at Zanzibar. The light brown ink of this text differs considerably from Livingstone’s dark brown overtext. The light brown ink also has a very distinct spectral response, as demonstrated by our images, where the ink remains on the page in a number of different spectral renderings while Livingstone’s ink disappears (see IC4, IC5, and sharpie).</p>

<p class="space2">Finally, one case of handwritten text merits additional mention. Multiple pages of Arthur Penrhyn Stanley’s <em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em> (1863) bear marginal annotations in the form of vertical lines in either gray or red pencil, as noted earlier (<a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link14">Annotation of one undertext</a>). The present editors have proceeded on the assumption that Livingstone made these annotations, but it is also possible that another hand added them. <a id="link6" name="link6"></a>If so, then this item would represent a unique case of a source text with both printed and handwritten undertext pre-dating Livingstone’s composition of the diary.</p>

<p>Second, Rev. James McNair, founder of the David Livingstone Centre, has annotated the diary leaf that bears 1870h:XVII, XVIII, XIX, and XX on its recto and Baker’s map on its verso.</p>

<p>All of the above additions appear to be in pencil and have a spectral response quite distinct from other kinds of writing on the given page (for instance, see the IC3 and sharpie renderings of page 1870h:XVII).</p>

<p>In contrast to the textual contributions from other hands, Livingstone’s use of inks and pencils to compose the 1870 Field Diary bears a rather complex character because of the variety of ways in which he wrote, rewrote, or otherwise revised and expanded his text.</p>

The spectral image suppresses the printed text and differentiates the two different handwritten inks by rendering one in blue (Zingifure), the other in black (iron gall).</span></p>

<p>When he set out for Manyema in 1869, Livingstone anticipated passing through the region relatively fast, and the evidence suggests – most notably in the case of the materials used to create both the 1870 and 1871 Field Diaries (as well as the letters from this period) – that he packed limited supplies. As a result, the inks used on the pages of field diaries and the letters from this period (including the five letters included in this critical edition) help chart how Livingstone’s supplies dwindled over time and how he attempted to compensate for this loss.</p>

<p class="space2">In addition to this larger situation, Livingstone’s choices as a writer – what he writes and when – also appear to impact the character of ink on his diary pages. These choices result in an inconsistency in the material characteristics of the ink that cannot be ascribed simply to dwindling supplies. <a id="link8" name="link8"></a>Rather elements of Livingstone’s overall composition practices have produced additional nuances in his use of ink and pencil on the diary’s pages. This section explores these nuances and their implications.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Pre-composition (pencil and iron gall ink).</strong> Initially, Livingstone used the 1870 Field Diary source materials in the ways one might expect: for reading and annotation, as well as for note-taking and calculations unrelated to the texts’ content (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link12">Initial Stages of Creation</a>).</p>

The processing removes Livingstone\'s overtext and shows what the page looked like before Livingstone began writing this segment of the 1870 Field Diary.</span></p>

<p>The evidence available prevents a definitive characterization of the amount of time Livingstone used the source materials in this way, but it could have been a year or two if not more since some of the source texts date back to 1863. Because there is a diverse selection of inks and pencil from this period, we conclude that Livingstone made the pre-composition marks over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>The notes and calculations consist mainly of a series in gray pencil on page 1871a:LXXVI [v.1], while the marginal annotations appear in both gray and red pencil on a selection of pages from Stanley’s <em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em> (the IC1 and IC3 processed spectral image renderings best foreground the calculations and annotations). Additional short undertext notes and calculations (now in a brown iron gall ink that seem very similar to that used for the main text of the 1870 Field Diary) appear on 1870i:LII and 1871b:LXXXVII.</p>

In this case, the processing demonstrates decisively that Livingstone drew the map in an ink that differs from that used for the surrounding text. This point, in combination with the fact that the map appears to lie below the surrounding text, suggests that Livingstone drew the map first, then added the other text at a later date.</span></p>

<p class="space2">Finally, Livingstone appears to have used a rather different, nearly black iron gall ink to compose the map on 1870h:XVII, portions of the text on 1871a:LXXVI [v.1], the text and map on 1871a:[LXXVI v2.], and one squiggle to correct ink flow on 1870b:[8].<a id="link9" name="link9"></a> (The latter is especially visible in the IC5 rendering, while the former elements emerge best in the IC4 renderings.)</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Preliminary composition and additions (iron gall ink).</strong> Even cursory review of the 1870 Field Diary pages shows that Livingstone used a brown iron gall ink for the vast majority of the main text. Roughly speaking, the ink appears consistent from page to page and, whatever the spectral image processing method used, appears to have a generally consistent spectral response.</p>

This page offers an example where the ink has a fairly consistent character for the span of the whole page.</span></p>

<p>However, this represents one area where the evidence of our current spectral images is not conclusive as the thickening of ink can produce visual results similar to more minute shifts in the material character of the ink. As a result, our spectral images in this case only provide useful data when the inks on the page are significantly different.</p>

<p>That said, a variety of gradations are still distinguishable in Livingstone’s iron gall ink. Some of these seem consistent with Livingstone dipping his pen then writing till he needed to redip it and did so (see 1871b:LXXIX for a particularly notable example of this mid-sentence). In such cases, the character of the iron gall ink evolves from being dark and consistent to being lighter and more splotchy, as the ink in the pen runs out.</p>

Livingstone appears to switch inks in the middle of the sentence (top center of page, four lines down), but actually the change in the character of his ink most likely derives from him redipping his pen.</span></p>

<p>This process applies to both shorter, single-page stretches of text and longer, multi-page sequences, where the stark contrast between the ink on the earlier and latter pages would otherwise suggest that the material characteristics of the ink had changed significantly (for instance, the pages in 1870c, 1871b, 1871e, or even 1870e:X-1870i:XXI).</p>

<p>Other gradations, however, suggest a more complex and, at times, non-sequential composition scenario. In some instances, the characteristics of the ink on some diary pages indicate that Livingstone first pre-numbered those pages with Roman numerals, then added the rest of the text on the page at a later time (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/structuring-1870-field-diary#link5">Sequencing by Roman Numeral</a>), a practice that he would also carry over to the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods#link5">1871 Field Diary</a>.</p>

<p>In such cases in the 1870 Field Diary, the iron gall ink Livingstone uses to write the numeral contrasts in shade and/or consistency with the text that covers the rest of the page. At times, the placement of the numeral on the page – for instance, clearly crammed into a corner on the page – also indicates that Livingstone added the numeral at a later time.</p>

The processing removes or diminishes almost all of Livingstone\'s text at the top of the page except for the page number (in the upper left-hand corner), which was an after-the-fact addition in another ink (most likely Zingifure).</span></p>

<p>In other instances, gradations emerge when the character of Livingstone’s ink changes over the span of a single page or from page to page. In terms of a single page, such shifts appear in one of two ways:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1. On occasion, Livingstone revises a given passage with an obvious after-the-fact addition in iron gall ink that is thicker and/or darker than the ink of the original passage. Livingstone generally places such additions above or below the main line of text and uses a caret to indicate the place in the text where the addition should inserted (e.g., 1870b:[32], [38], [56]).</p>

<p class="rteindent1">2. On other occasions, gradations in ink point to an alternate composition process at work. For instance, between 1870j:LXIX and LXII, which appear top-to-bottom over two still-bound pages of Stanley’s <em>The Bible: Its Form and Substance</em>, a change from orange to brown iron gall ink appears just after the page break but before a new, dated entry.</p>

<p>The shift suggests that some kind of change in the material composition of Livingstone’s ink has occurred, but the location of the shift (especially when seen in the full context of the two pages) indicates that Livingstone wrote the pages in the following order: 1870j:LXIX, then the top of 1870j:LXII, then (after altering his ink) the rest of page 1870j:LXII. In other words, he wrote these pages out of numerical (and chronological) sequence.</p>

The processed image suggests that Livingstone first wrote the text at the top of the page in one kind of ink, then went back and wrote the page number and the rest of the text on the page in another kind of ink.</span></p>

<p>1871b:LXXX presents an even more unusual scenario with the number and text on the second half of the page clearly written in one kind of iron gall ink, and the intervening text in another. Such characteristics indicate that Livingstone either started this page at one time, then returned to it later to add the numeral and the second half of the text, or wrote most of the page first, but left a gap for the opening section, which he added later.</p>

<p class="space2">Whatever the case, we can conclude that Livingstone apparently did not write this page top to bottom in one sitting.<a id="link10" name="link10"></a> More broadly, this and the foregoing cases of ink use demonstrate that a shift in the characteristics of Livingstone’s iron gall ink need not be incidental and can, indeed, result from a more complex composition process.</p>

<p>The specific dating of the saturation remains uncertain, but it occurred in Livingstone’s lifetime because reference to both the natural light and processed spectral images indicates that Livingstone sought to counter the damage from the saturation (and subsequent blotting of his ink) by reinking some of the most smeared words.</p>

<p>He did this in two ways. On portions of 1870i:LXIX-LV [v.2], he apparently reinked the most damaged text at the top and bottom of the pages in iron gall ink, although our spectral images prevent reaching any definitive conclusions about this iron gall reinking because, as noted, the thickening of ink can produce visual results similar to more minute shifts in the material character of the ink. More interestingly, Livingstone also turned to Zingifure ink to re-ink some of the most smeared words on 1870i:XLII-LVII (and perhaps elsewhere). Since Livingstone did not create Zingifure ink until April 1871 (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a>), he could not have carried out the reinking in the 1870 Field Diary until after that date.</p>

Here, uniquely, Livingstone has rewritten several smeared words on the last two lines of page directly below in Zingifure ink. The rewritten words are quite faint and even in this processed image are barely visible.</span></p>

<p>In restoring the smeared words, Livingstone either retraces in Zingifure ink directly on top of the original words (the majority of cases) or rewrites the words directly below the original words (only one instance of this, on the bottom of page LVII). In natural light images, the reinking appears as faint orange Zingifure ink on top of the main brown iron gall ink, while our IC4 renderings bring the Zingifure ink into more prominence (also see the IC5 and pseudo_v1 renderings).</p>

<p>However, the 1870 Field Diary also contains two notable exceptions to this reinking practice. In one instance, Livingstone uses Zingifure ink – in the midst of reinking other words on the page – to make a significant revision to the text. When he complains that he cannot get “any carriers save the worthless liberated slaves who by thieving lying and <s>fornication</s> [cowardice] have been a perpetual annoyance during all this Journey,” he substitutes the milder "cowardice" for the more graphic "fornication" (1870i:XLII, with Zingifure deletion and addition included).</p>

This ASI highlights the most notable moment of self-censorship in the 1870 Field Diary when Livingstone revises a reference, at image center, to his men\'s penchant for "fornication" to "cowardice."</span></p>

<p>In other words, Livingstone self censors in order to revise his text so that it reflect Victorian notions of decorum. Though the 1870 Field Diary has typically been considered an unrevised or first-stage document, then, we see instances where Livingstone is already revising with potential publication in mind.</p>

<p>In another instance, unrelated to <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link6">the big stain</a>, Livingstone composes an entire page in Zingifure ink (1870h:XX). This undated page represents one of a sequence of four on the back of Baker’s map (Livingstone 1870h:[map]) and, in addition to the Zingifure ink, internal references (specifically an allusion to February 1871) show that Livingstone wrote this page long after both the diary pages that precede it (the last date on 1870h:XIX is 2 November 1870) and succeed it (the first date on 1870i:XXII is 3 November 1870; 1870i:XXI bears no date, but the page’s appearance suggests it was written just before 1870i:XXII).</p>

In this image, the color of the text on the page at left, the longest after-the-fact addition in the 1870 Field Diary, differs considerably from the adjacent page at right (as well as those below).</span></p>

<p>The odd placement of the page in Zingifure ink as well as its textual and material characteristics thus open a further dimension of complexity in Livingstone’s composition sequence for his field diary entries and suggests that other instances of asequential composition may yet be awaiting discovery by scholars. Such instances merit further consideration because they can diversify our understanding of Livingstone’s composition process and, potentially, the processes of other contemporary travelers to Africa.</p>

<p class="rtecenter">*</p>

<p>Close analysis of the inks and pencil marks on the pages of the 1870 Field Diary, therefore, reveals the many ways that Livingstone and others have shaped and reshaped this text over time. Moreover, our analysis shows that a single composition model does not suffice, but rather that the process of creating the text alternates between linear and iterative trajectories. The next part of this essay explores the process of creation further by turning from issues of text to elements of manuscript materiality.</p>

        'value' => '<p>David Livingstone stands at the intersection of many of the most controversial events of the past two centuries. He was a missionary who helped introduce European religious and cultural values to Africans. He was an abolitionist who fought for the end of the East African slave trade. He was an explorer whose records of life in Africa helped inform the imperialist “scramble” for the continent in the decades after his death. In all these guises, Livingstone’s life continues to resonate into the postcolonial present. The vicissitudes of his <a href="/life-and-times/livingstone’s-posthumous-reputation">posthumous reputation</a> reflect changes in Western society’s understandings of race, culture, religion, and nationhood over the past century and a half.</p>

<p>We have not entered lightly into the task of preserving the legacy of such a controversial figure. We attempt neither to vilify nor lionize but rather to rethink Livingstone, his iconography, and the western and non-western environments in which he did his work as a traveler, missionary, abolitionist, and scientist. As a result, we engage the many dimensions of Livingstone’s legacy by publishing <a href="/islandora/search">digital editions</a> of original Livingstone manuscripts (what historian Roy C. Bridges calls the “‘raw’ record” of exploration [1998:7]) and by providing <a href="/life-and-times">critical essays</a> that locate Livingstone\'s life and work at the intersection of diverse competing historical forces. Likewise, we emphasize the dependent nature of Livingstone’s travels with and among non-western groups, while our site design complicates reigning visual and textual representations of Livingstone.</p>

<p>Yet the study of imperial history is always thwarted by its sources of information. Scholars of nineteenth-century exploration narratives, in particular, have debated the ethics of using the written accounts of European explorers of Africa – often the only written accounts we have – to better engage with and understand the populations of Africa. These descriptions, scholars argue, are inflected with the explorers’ imperial biases and “invariably [reflect] the ideas of difference prevalent in their own society at the time that they wrote their travel narratives” (Kennedy 2013: 202).</p>

<p>Although no digital museum, library, or archive can redress such biases, <em>Livingstone Online</em> uses&nbsp;digital technologies to foreground the often lost hands, voices, and sources that shaped Livingstone’s work and writing. However, the site also highlights its limits as a digital project. We recognize the contingency of our endeavor and acknowledge that no archive is neutral, the postcolonial archive perhaps least so (see “The Postcolonial Archive” for more).</p>

<p>In 2015, we unveiled a new site design that encourages lateral, anti-hierarchical exploration of content in order to foster user-led interpretation over passive reception of authorized knowledge. The site’s six section pages, for instance, each rely on a diverse range of historical illustrations and contemporary images to complicate the notion of a definitive Livingstone. In this approach, we seek to replace iconic, singular representations of Livingstone with images that show him in multiple relations to the people around him. A variety of contextualizing materials, additionally, offer insights into related topics such as the <a href="/life-and-times/southern-africans-and-advent-colonialism">history of southern Africa</a>, <a href="/life-and-times/18th-and-19th-century-european-expeditions">eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European expeditions</a>, <a href="/life-and-times/victorian-medicine">Victorian medicine</a>, and <a href="/life-and-times/livingstone’s-posthumous-reputation">Livingstone’s memorialization</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside this remediation of historical sources, we also make a sustained attempt to open our own collaborative work to critique. We enter into this project understanding that any archive or museum is an interpretive structure. This is perhaps doubly true of digital archives and museums, due to the additional layers of mediation: “digital resources cannot but help make arguments about whatever it is they digitize” (Mussell 2014: 384). In creating <em>Livingstone Online</em>, we thus highlight the complicated paths Livingstone’s words have taken from nineteenth-century Africa to the twenty-first-century web <em>and</em> from the analogue to the digital.</p>

<p>In this spirit, we provide <a href="/about-site/leap-2013-2017-project-history-part-i">narratives and visual representations</a> of the project team at work and enable users to download <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-project-documents">hundreds of unedited documents</a> produced in the course of project research. In addition, we offer access to our <a href="/sites/default/files/about-this-site/the-theory-behind-livingstone-online/Livingstone_Online-Complete-TEI-Transcription-Materials.zip">transcriptions and encoding guidelines</a>, the many <a href="/behind-scenes/practices-standards-and-arrangements">standards</a> by which we have developed our data, and <a href="/islandora/search">self-documenting downloadable archival packets</a> for over 1,100 items that allow users to work directly with our core digital data.</p>

<p>Such transparency promotes knowledge transfer, but also opens every step of our digital development process to outside critical interrogation. In our provision of such documentation, we hope to initiate a conversation about the value of open-access digital museums and archives, the limitations of site creation, the biases and assumptions inherent in our own work, and the ways that technological advances shape our knowledge of the past. We encourage users to think of <em>Livingstone Online</em> not as a static source of information, but rather as a series of self-reflexive interventions into critical discourse and as a polyphonic digital project of continued meaning making.</p>

<p>Due to the paper used and Livingstone’s overtext, the letter to Waller is today very difficult to read. Where Livingstone’s iron gall ink has bled through the page, two layers of text run into one another, while on the portions of the page with printed text (or with the handwritten address to Livingstone), three superimposed layers of text are often visible.</p>

<p>Although problematic for the Livingstone scholar, these characteristics – in addition to the fact that the letter contains three types of ink (Livingstone’s, that of the printed text, and that of the handwritten address to Livingstone) – made the letter of great interest to the imaging team. The team recognized that the letter offered the chance to use the multispectral imaging and processing techniques developed to separate the "overtext" and "undertext" in the <a href="http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/" target="_blank">Archimedes Palimpsest</a>, a medieval parchment-based document, for the study of a nineteenth-century paper-based document. Furthermore, the letter’s physical characteristics – such as the stains (most evident on [1] and [2]), the seal (on [4]), and the creases on each page where the letter had been folded – also presented an opportunity for innovative imaging and processing.</p>

<p>The letter was transported from the Conservation Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to the imaging lab at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland by a three-person team. At the Walters, in order to spectrally image the letter, the imaging team used a fully integrated spectral imaging system that included a 39-megapixel Megavision monochrome camera along with a low-heat spectral illumination system from Equipoise Imaging. This system illuminated each leaf with light-emitting diodes (LED) in various spectral bands, with each spectral band captured by the camera in a series of registered monochrome images so that a given point on every image lined up.</p>

<p>Although the Archimedes Palimpsest Project captured images at thirteen different wavelengths, for the Livingstone letter the imaging team increased this number to twenty-three. The team also used an experimental "color wheel" with filters to capture UV fluorescence from the manuscript leaves for later processing. All of the raw images were taken sequentially without moving the paper in between exposures. As a result, every image is in perfect registration with every other, allowing several images to be combined so as to enhance different parts of the document. The images, which totaled 13 GB as raw images, were stored as smaller archival TIFFs on external drives and distributed to members of the team for processing and further study.</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s writings recurrently return to the problem of fever as the greatest threat to the health of travellers in Africa. Livingstone died shortly before modern germ theory was developed and well before tropical medicine was established as a medical discipline. His accounts of the causes and cure of fever differ considerably from those given today. In addition, in Livingstone\'s time, there was great difference of opinion within the medical and scientific community as to the nature of fever.</p>

<p>Today there is, broadly speaking, consensus. Fever is usually regarded as a symptom of infection, and different infections produce different diseases. According to modern views, the infectious diseases that Livingstone might have encountered were of two sorts: first, diseases unique to tropical and subtropical climates, and second, diseases he could have seen in Europe.</p>

<p>A number of diseases peculiar to the equatorial latitudes, which were probably endemic in Livingstone\'s day, are caused by parasites. These parasites are transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes, flies, fleas, ticks and lice. The diseases include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>malaria</li>
	<li>trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)</li>
	<li>filariasis</li>
	<li>schistosomiasis</li>
	<li>blackwater fever</li>
	<li>dengue fever</li>
	<li>leishmaniasis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specificity fundamentally distinguishes the views of Livingstone and his contemporaries from those held today. Doctors now regard febrile diseases as specific entities because they have specific causes: malarial parasites, worms, bacteria, and so on.</p>

<p>Livingstone, however, perceived fever (with exceptions) as a single, essential disease whose form varied according to a host of factors both individual and general. In this view, the form changed according to age, sex, heredity, constitution, climate, and diet, as well as what we might now see as unscientific causes such as moral influences and occupation.</p>

<p>From Livingstone’s perspective there were no such things as tropical diseases, merely varieties of fever encountered in Africa provoked by local conditions. The same set of causes in a healthy, robust individual might produce a common cold and in a sickly person lead to fatal fever. In the 12 May 1859 entry in his Zambesi journal, Livingstone noted: "The attacks [of fever] however were so modified by our being well provided for [... they] have resembled greatly common colds."</p>

<p><a name="ft2"></a></p>

<h4><span style="font-family:crimson text;"><strong>Fevers from Africa to London</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>In appropriate circumstances similar fevers could and (according to contemporary observers) did appear in, say, London. Writing to Thomas Maclear on 21 June 1862, Livingstone observed: "trying to get rid of the fever in the delta is like trying to cure the fever in the low overcrowded lodging houses of London or in houses with open cesspools beneath." In other words, Livingstone perceived fever to be a single disease with local manifestations.</p>

<p>Two letters Livingstone wrote to the <em>Medical Times and Gazette</em> (Livingstone and Kirk 1860; Livingstone 1863) beautifully illustrate this view. In these letters, Livingstone and Kirk identify "<em>the</em> fever" (italics added), not fevers, as the great obstacle to the advance of European nations into Africa. They note that when Charles Livingstone had fever, the symptoms were "such as we see in Europe." Like public health reformers in Britain, Livingstone and Kirk also identify an "offensive smell" as a sign that fever is likely to be encountered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Livingstone and Kirk go on to detail their belief that swamps generate fever. This is as true of London as Africa or India. "You have actually a larger area of cesspool and marsh around and above London than exists in the Elephant Swamp," Livingstone writes. Individually, fever arises in those who are "worn out by constitutional disease" and are "inactive," rather than individuals who engage in morally uplifting "active exercise" and "hard work." Additionally, Livingstone and Kirk suggest that a "good diet" is more valuable than quinine and that taking fever "in its milder form first" to adapt one’s constitution will also aid prevention (Livingstone 1863).</p>

<p>This account of fever had great virtues in the nineteenth century, although it is completely alien to modern views. First, the account permitted very close-grained observation of febrile attacks and their relations to the environment. Livingstone was an excellent natural historian and his descriptions of the areas where fever prevailed include accounts of the dangers of low-lying marshy ground and the association between fevers and the presence of mosquitoes and tsetse fly (he did not say these creatures transmitted or caused fever). Today specialists regard these insects as the vectors of malaria and trypanosomiasis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Livingstone\'s model of fever stressed the virtues of sanitation. When two hundred liberated slaves were congregated together, their "dropping" produced a "pest hole." What Livingstone\'s approach to fever could not do was generate powerful drugs which could be used to target disease-producing parasites. This development was a consequence of the causal model built into modern germ theory and the experimental approaches of the laboratory sciences.</p>

<p>Nonetheless Livingstone was well aware of the value of quinine for fever that assumed an intermittent or "malarious" character, although he would not have recognised a distinct disease, malaria. In 1850, he adopted the practice of giving quinine with a purgative and found it successful in the case of two of his children.</p>

<p>"Quinine," Livingstone&nbsp; writes, "was found invaluable in the cure of the complaint [malaria], as soon as pains in the back, sore bones, headache, yawning, quick and sometimes intermittent pulse, noticeable pulsations of the jugulars, with suffused eyes, hot skin, and foul tongue, began” (Livingstone and Livingstone 1865:83).</p>

<p>His remedy was "composed of from six to eight grains of resin of jalap, the same of rhubarb, and three each of calomel and quinine, made up into four pills, with tincture of cardamoms, usually relieved all the symptoms in five or six hours. Four pills are a full dose for a man – one will suffice for a woman. They received from our men the name of \'rousers,\' from their efficacy in rousing up even those most prostrated” (Livingstone and Livingstone 1865:83).</p>

<p>LEAP: The <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project is a four-year initiative (2013-17) to develop <em>Livingstone Online</em> and create a critical edition of Livingstone\'s final diaries and journals (1866-73). The present history focuses on the first year and a half of LEAP (September 2013-June 2015), when the project team completed a significant portion of the work related to the redevelopment and expansion of the original <em>Livingstone Online</em> site (2005-12). The project\'s goals are detailed below. The critical edition of the diaries and journals will appear in a discrete site section when complete in 2017.</p>

<p>The present narrative discusses each strand of LEAP and includes supporting documentation in the form of photographs and downloadable project documents. Collectively, these materials provide an intimate look into the development of the present site. It is our hope that the materials will serve as a resource for others interested in developing similar digital projects. The provision of these materials also grows out of our project\'s commitment to methodological transparency. In this spirit, the narrative closes with a summary of some of our principal project challenges and the lessons learned from those challenges.</p>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em> (2010-12) and a growing collaboration with <em>Livingstone Online</em> spurred [qtip: Adrian S. Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.]\'s interest in using advanced imaging technology to study nineteenth-century British manuscripts. While at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Wisnicki met [qtip: Megan Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co- director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.], a Victorianist at Point Park University in Pittsburgh. The two began to discuss a future collaboration on the Livingstone projects and soon settled on applying for an NEH Humanities Collections and Reference Resources Grant (HCRR).</p>

<p>The scale of the HCRR grant would allow for an overhaul and expansion of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, while enabling that project to be integrated with the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em> – thereby creating a comprehensive resource for scholars, scientists, and the public alike. To support this project, Wisnicki brought in a significant number of collaborators from the <em>Spectral Imaging Project</em> and secured the participation of the David Livingstone Centre, the National Library of Scotland, and the UCLA Digital Library.</p>

<p>The newly formed project team settled on "The <em>Livingstone Online</em> Enrichment and Access Project (LEAP)" for the name of their project. They spent the months of May, June, and July 2012 developing the grant. In the application, they set out six principal goals:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">1) The redevelopment of the <em>Livingstone Online</em> website to facilitate preservation, access, use, and future scholarship;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">2) The integration of all image and transcription data and metadata from <em>Livingstone Online</em> (2005-12) and the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em> (2010-12) to common standards;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">3) The addition of new digital materials from the David Livingstone Centre (3,600 manuscript images) and the National Library of Scotland (1,000 manuscript images);</p>

<p class="rteindent1">4) A critical, electronic edition of Livingstone\'s final diaries and journals (1866-1873), possibly the most comprehensive surviving collection of manuscript documents related to any single nineteenth-century British expedition to Africa;</p>

<p class="rteindent1">5) An outreach program to take the work of <em>Livingstone Online</em> into the classroom and to produce a digitized teaching resources to be distributed through the site; and</p>

<p class="rteindent1">6) Full documentation of all project work.</p>

<p>The team thus set out an ambitious agenda, one that would take <em>Livingstone Online</em> and the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</em>, already well-established projects, to new levels.</p>

<p>On 8 April 2013, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] received the exciting news that the NEH grant application for LEAP had been successful. However, eight months had elapsed between submission of the grant and announcement of the results. During that time, Wisnicki, the director of LEAP, accepted a new position at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), one of the leaders for digital humanities research in the US. The NEH award also came with a caveat, a 21% reduction to $275,000 from the original ask of $350,000, with a request that Wisnicki and the project team modify the workplan accordingly.</p>

<p>These developments had four consequences. First, the team scaled back the project to exclude the planned integration of a handful of analytical tools into <em>Livingstone Online</em>. Second, the project team moved the start date from 1 May 2013 to 1 September 2013 to allow for Wisnicki\'s change of locale. Third, a number of staff from UNL\'s Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) joined the LEAP team to provide local support on the project. Finally, Wisnicki transferred the grant from IUP to UNL, a move not without significant challenges due to the combination of reduced funding and differing F&amp;A rules between IUP and UNL.</p>

<p>On 27 September 2013, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and project manager [qtip: Michael B. Toth|Michael B. Toth (President, R.B. Toth Associates). Program manager for LEAP and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] visited the UCLA Digital Library for LEAP\'s formal kickoff. They met with Digital Library director [qtip: Stephen Davison|Stephen Davison (Director, UCLA Digital Library Program). Institutional co-lead for LEAP.], librarian [qtip: Lisa McAulay|Lisa McAulay (Librarian, UCLA Digital Library Program). Institutional co-lead for LEAP.] and other UCLA staff, as well as the CDRH\'s [qtip: Brian Pytlik Zillig|Brian Pytlik Zillig (Professor and Digital Initiatives Librarian, Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). CDRH co-lead for LEAP.], who would lead UNL data management and who joined remotely. The team devoted a good portion of the day to discussing the existing Livingstone data and metadata as well as the new data that would be incoming from the National Library of Scotland and the David Livingstone Centre. Developing and integrating this heterogenous data would be perhaps the single most complex and difficult task in the project.</p>

<p>Overall project planning also received significant attention. The team reviewed and modified Toth\'s program plan line by line to ensure it covered all project objectives and that it ordered dependant tasks in logical sequences. The team also decided to hold monthly meetings to track and revise the plan. The periodic reviews would serve not only to flag project tasks that fell behind schedule, but would also identify the downstream impact of such delays. Regular recourse to an NEH compliance matrix, which Toth would soon develop, would also enable the team to track and confirm in detail that it was working to fulfill every promise made in the NEH grant application.</p>

<p>In addition, the LA kickoff gave Wisnicki the chance to meet with the UCLA Digital Library Program staff face-to-face. Incredibly, the opportunity for such an encounter had never arisen during two years of sustained and coordinated work on the <em>Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.</em> The meeting, everyone agreed, underscored the value of personal contact in projects such as LEAP.</p>

<p>The LEAP team devoted most of the week of 14 October 2014 to the formal project kickoff in the UK. Since the team had submitted the original grant application over a year ago, the UK kickoff served to reinvigorate the collaborative, transatlantic nature of LEAP and, in some cases, establish new relationships between project team members and staff at supporting institutions.</p>

<p>The itinerary began with a day of meetings at the David Livingstone Centre (near Glasgow), followed by an all-day visit to the University of Glasgow (GU) Photographic Unit where digitization of David Livingstone Centre (DLC) manuscript would occur, and concluded with a series of meetings at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh. The week also included a visit to <a href="https://www.emms.org/" target="_blank">EMMS International</a> in Edinburgh, whose office manager [qtip: Joe Cooney|Joe Cooney (Office Manager, EMMS International).] had recently offered to share with <em>Livingstone Online</em> some Livingstone letters in the society’s possession.</p>

<p>The DLC visit, under the guidance of property managers [qtip: Karen Carruthers|Karen Carruthers (Property Manager, David Livingstone Centre). Institutional contact for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] and [qtip: Alison Ritchie|Alison Ritchie (Property Manager, David Livingstone Centre). Institutional contact for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] as well as archivist [qtip: Anne Martin|Anne Martin (Archivist, David Livingstone Centre). Associate director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], enabled the team to view the Livingstone manuscripts to be digitized in person – the only time most of the members would see these manuscripts during the whole of LEAP – and to discuss the intended outreach program. During the subsequent visit to the GU Photo Unit, the team toured the digitization facilities as well as the GU Special Collections archives where the manuscripts would be held, and the team made plans and defined standards for the subsequent transfer of data and metadata.</p>

<p>The week\'s last meetings with archivists [qtip: David McClay|David McClay (Manuscripts Curator, John Murray Archive, National Library of Scotland). Institutional contact for <em>Livingstone Online.</em>] and [qtip: Alison Metcalfe|Alison Metcalfe (Manuscripts Curator, National Library of Scotland). Institutional contact for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] helped to finalize the number of digitized manuscripts that the NLS would provide to <em>Livingstone Online</em>, the intellectual property issues, and metadata used by the NLS. The meetings concluded with the surprise news that the NLS would also be willing to provide <em>Livingstone Online</em> with a trove of images created as part of the NLS bicentenary exhibit "Picturing Africa: Illustrating Livingstone\'s travels." This was an exciting development, as the provision of the materials would significantly enhance contextual study of Livingstone\'s life through the new <em>Livingstone Online</em> site.</p>

<p>The LEAP UK kickoff thus resulted in concrete and detailed plans for the delivery of 5,000 manuscript images. Work on digitizing the DLC manuscripts under the guidance of the GU Photographic Unit Manager [qtip: Stephen McCann|Stephen McCann (Manager, Photographic Unit, University of Glasgow Library).

Digitization specialist for LEAP.] and [qtip: India Fullarton|India Fullarton (Scanner/Digitizer, Photographic Unit, University of Glasgow Library). Digitization specialist for LEAP.] was soon underway. A digitization master-list served to coordinate the process. The master-list, based on the original list submitted to the NEH, was expanded with bibliographical data from DLC archivist [qtip: Anne Martin|Anne Martin (Archivist, David Livingstone Centre). Associate director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] as well as conservator information from [qtip: Suzanne Lamb|Suzanne Lamb (Conservator, National Trust for Scotland).].</p>

<p>In carrying out the work, GU staff deployed three different digitization systems. For smaller manuscripts (such as field diaries), the staff used an ATIZ book copying system. This allowed the books to be well supported in the Atiz’s unique ‘V’ shaped cradle system and the digitization was conducted using a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) Canon camera systems. The digitization team at the University of Glasgow also used a copy stand setup with Nikon DSLR camera systems, when they encountered anomalies not suited to the Atiz Bookdrive. The staff turned to a flat copy stand and the use of a Hassleblad 50-megapixel H4D-50MS camera for maps and larger manuscripts such as the Unyanyembe Journal. The Hassleblad captured manuscripts using the 4-shot (Multishot) mode for best resolution and exceptional quality.</p>

<p>For all items, the GU staff took 16-bit RAW images, which were then converted to 8-bit TIFFs at 600 ppi, color corrected, adjusted and cropped with file naming to LEAP standards done by both automatic and manual methods. The team used Adobe Bridge, Hasselblad’s Phocus, Camera Control Pro, and Exiftool software for their digitization workflow.</p>

<p>GU production of digital images lasted until the end of 2014. Once received in the US via FTP, each image underwent rigorous quality control. [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S.

<p>To start, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Kumari|Ashanka Kumari (Graduate Student, University of Louisville). Research assistant for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] turned to the most formidable LEAP task: data review. The original <em>Livingstone Online</em> project team (2005-12) had collected image data from a range of institutions. In the interest of long-term digital preservation, the LEAP team decided to use the original, unsorted TIFF manuscript images. This involved examining over 10,000 image files, most of which had little if any documentation. From the fall of 2013 to the spring of 2014, Wisnicki and Kumari sorted and labeled these files, checking and rechecking images against institutional holdings to identify missing, incomplete, or incorrectly identified images.</p>

<p>The process also involved reviewing all existing archival permission agreements. <em>Livingstone Online</em> initially developed during an era when the collaborator permission agreements for digital projects had not yet become standardized or even, in some cases, not used at all. Wisnicki, [qtip: Chris Lawrence|Chris Lawrence (professor emeritus, University College London). Former director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>; now director emeritus of the project.], and [qtip: Jared McDonald|Jared McDonald (Lecturer, University of the Free State). Associate project scholar and lead contact for South African research for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.] now contacted all institutional and individual project collaborators to secure or confirm permission as needed.</p>

<p>Then there was the metadata. The original <em>Livingstone Online</em> team had produced some 2,200 MySQL metadata records (e.g., dates, recipients, repository shelfmarks, etc.) for Livingstone\'s known correspondence as well as 300 records (master IDs, titles, image rights) for illustrative data. The team, under the guidance of UCLA\'s [qtip: Claudia Horning|Claudia Horning (Metadata Specialist, UCLA Library). Metadata specialist for LEAP.], reviewed this metadata and carefully converted it to the MODS format, the project standard determined by the UCLA Digital Library.</p>

<p>Finally, [qtip: McAulay|Lisa McAulay (Librarian, UCLA Digital Library Program). Institutional co-lead for LEAP.] led UCLA students in cropping legacy image data so as to facilitate and enhance the online display of manuscript images, while [qtip: Smutniak|Frank Smutniak (Web Developer, Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Web developer for LEAP.] wrote a series of Groovy, JSON, and Ruby scripts to convert all images and transcriptions to a uniform file naming standard that would be applied across the <em>Livingstone Online</em> digital collection. Smutniak also created scripts to add Dublin Core metadata to all legacy images and, in the interests of facilitating discovery, to generate standalone XMP and TXT metadata files to accompany each image. The overall process of data development lasted nearly a year and a half and would resume in the final phase of LEAP.</p>

<p>Nearly 700 XML-based transcriptions of original manuscripts formed the final piece of legacy data puzzle. The transcriptions had been produced by previous waves of <em>Livingstone Online</em> staff (2005-13) according to a variety of standards. Starting in October 2013, [qtip: James Cummings|James Cummings (Senior Academic Research Technology Specialist, IT Services, University of Oxford). TEI specialist for <em>Livingstone Online</em> and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] developed a set of encoding guidelines for all <em>Livingstone Online</em> transcriptions – past and future. He offered recommendations on the creation of a TEI ODD (One Document Does-it-all) that would use a schema to ensure that all legacy transcriptions conformed to the LEAP TEI standard and, moreover, would contain LEAP encoding guidelines. Finally, he outlined the way forward for developing the schema and converting transcription files to the agreed standard.</p>

<p>By March 2014, the LEAP transcription team was ready to begin its work in transcribing 12 of the surviving 17 of Livingstone\'s last field diaries (1886-73), the massive Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), and all of the letters held by the David Livingstone Centre. The transcription team, led by [qtip: Megan Ward|Megan Ward (Assistant Professor, Oregon State University). Co-director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] and [qtip: Heather F. Ball|Heather F. Ball (Project Cataloger, The Morgan Library &amp; Museum). Coordinating Project Scholar for <em>Livingstone Online</em>.], soon came to encompass collaborators from previous phases of <em>Livingstone Online</em> and the <em>Spectral Imaging Project</em> as well as [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.]\'s students from both Indiana University of Pennsylvania and University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p>

5. Final text-only proofing ([qtip: Chris Lawrence|Chris Lawrence (professor emeritus, University College London). Former director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>; now director emeritus of the project.])<br />
6. Final overall review (Adrian S. Wisnicki)</p>

<p>Each transcription underwent six stages of production, review, and quality control. A Google Drive-based project workflow coordinated the team efforts and streamlined scheduling, while recourse to the Spacely server at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln facilitated the exchange of transcription files among team members. As transcription practices evolved, Wisnicki and Ball updated the encoding manual and worked closely with LEAP team members to address, resolve, and track all encoding issues. A year and a half after starting, the LEAP transcription team had thus successfully transcribed and encoded nearly all of the final field diaries, some 350 (of 700 pages) of the Unyanyembe Journal, and all of the DLC letters.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the work of recovering the <em>Livingstone Online</em> image and transcription data and metadata proved to be a major LEAP accomplishment, as detailed in the preliminary and interim data reports. The LEAP team correlated all legacy images and transcriptions, produced MODS metadata records for all of Livingstone\'s known correspondence as well as a variety of additional items, and, most importantly, identified images for some 300 items that the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team had collected, but not processed, in the project\'s initial phases.</p>

<p>Moreover, the data work enabled the LEAP team to reestablish links with archival institutions such as the Royal Geographical Society and SOAS, University of London, both of which provided dozens of manuscript images, free of charge, to fill out the <em>Livingstone Online</em> digital image collection. Additionally, through extensive metadata review as well as by ransacking online auction records, [qtip: Wisnicki|Adrian S. Wisnicki (Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Director of <em>Livingstone Online</em>, LEAP, and the Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project.] was able to correct and update an array of existing metadata records details, create some 150 new MODS records for items incoming from the DLC and NLS, and catalogue details of numerous Livingstone items auctioned during the last decade.</p>

<p>The collective result of these efforts meant that the new <em>Livingstone Online</em> would enhance the study of Livingstone and his life and times through the provision of a broadly expanded collection of items, while providing more information about these items than ever before.</p>

<p>To reach the present day, the 1870 Field Diary passed not only through hands and time, but also space. First, the source texts traveled from Britain (and elsewhere) to central Africa. Next, after Livingstone composed his diary, the manuscript journeyed with Livingstone through the areas of present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Zambia. When Livingstone passed away in 1873, his attendants transported his body along with the diary and other manuscripts to the east coast of Africa and then to Zanzibar.</p>

<p>From Zanzibar, the diary next traveled to Britain, where it further circulated among various individuals while the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874, ed. Horace Waller, pub. John Murray) were in preparation. Finally, Livingstone’s family members distributed the diary’s pages to the three repositories where the different fragments of the diary today reside. To the above, we might also add the travels of the fragments within the three repositories and the journey of the David Livingstone Centre fragments first to Stirling University for conservation in the 1986-87 and then to the National Library of Scotland for spectral imaging in 2010.</p>

<p>Such complex movements across such diverse spaces have left their marks on the diary’s pages. Yet in the majority of cases, it proves impossible to link specific marks to specific places, and it’s not always possible to exclude the chance that some marks are the product of multiple spaces.</p>

<p>Our project also sets limits on understanding the origins of these marks, particularly since our work does not extend from visual analysis of spectral images to, for instance, chemical analysis of the original leaves or to using comparative analysis of the many spectral signatures of the diary’s pages with databases of spectral signatures elsewhere.</p>

<p>As a result, discussion of the diary’s environmental traces must necessarily focus on description of what our project team can observe on the pages (or infer from those observations), with attention to the causes of these traces either limited to certain cases, significantly curtailed, and/or deferred to a future project.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family:crimson text;">Page Discoloration</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>Our spectral images of the 1870 Field Diary significantly enhance the visual prominence of page discolor due to wear and/or saturation. The presence of such discoloration can provide a gauge for assessing the relative amount of exposure or short- or long-term handling for a given set of diary pages.</p>

<p>However, drawing the line between discoloration due to wear or saturation or even between either of these factors and lamination (in the case of leaves from the David Livingstone Centre) proves difficult, so divisions between the factors treated in this subsection and the next must necessarily be arbitrary to a degree. That said, even a rough distinction enables us, first, to consider the different environmental factors at play in shaping the diary and, second, to lay potential groundwork for more advanced analysis in the future.</p>

The image highlights discoloration along the edges of the page, particularly in the upper left-hand corner where the discoloration coincides with the fading of Livingstone\'s ink.</span></p>

<p>In the majority of cases, discoloration covers some portion of either one or more edges of the given diary page or extends from the edges to cover more of the diary page as a whole. Our ICA_pseudo_32 processed spectral images best bring such discoloration to the fore, presenting it as a dark red that notably contrasts with the yellow, not otherwise discolored portions of the page.</p>

<p class="space2"><a id="link3" name="link3"></a>When studied alongside the natural light images, the spectral images also reveal that much of the discoloration occurred after Livingstone composed his diary as the patterned fading of his ink in some cases clearly coincides with the areas of the page where discoloration occurs (for a good example of this, see the tops and bottoms of 1870i:XXI-XXXII).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>First gathering</strong>. In terms of the first gathering (1870b), the discoloration follows one of three patterns, which alternate in a rather random fashion. Either the discoloration covers the whole page almost without exception, or it covers a prominent portion of the page, or it appears along one or more edges of the page.</p>

<p>The first pattern emerges on the very first and last pages of the first gathering (1870b:[1], [70]), and, somewhat inexplicably, on two facing pages near the beginning of the gathering (1870b:[12] and less so on [13]).</p>

Nearly the entire surface of this page is discolored, as shown by the red coloring in the processed spectral rendering.</span></p>

<p>The discoloration on the first and last pages (1870b:[1], [70]) might be ascribed to the additional environmental exposure that these pages received because of their position in the gathering. Since one or more leaves of this gathering are missing from the beginning (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/creating-1870-field-diary#link4">Gatherings</a>), it is also clear that this discoloration occurred after the missing leaves became detached.</p>

<p>The discoloration on the two facing pages (1870b:[12], [13]) might be due to the diary being left open here for a longer period of time, as when on display in a museum – although this explanation is speculative.</p>

<p>The second pattern of discoloration covers a significant portion (but not all) of a given page. Examples of this pattern appear along the top and bottom edges of 1870b:[6] (to a lesser degree) and 1870b:[7]; on the right and left edges of, respectively, 1870b:[9] and [10] (the recto and verso of a single leaf), on the right edge of 1870b:[19]; on the right edge of 1870b:[21] (to a lesser degree); and, finally, on the left edge of 1870b:[42].</p>

The dark edge shows how discoloration can cover a significant portion (but not all) of a given page in the first gathering.</span></p>

<p>In all of these cases, a clear relationship exists between page discoloration and it size in relation to the pages on either side. More specifically, Livingstone cut all the leaves of this first gathering from the margins of the <em>Quarterly Review</em> essay (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link4">Gatherings</a>) and his pruning resulted in leaves of different sizes. When the leaves are arranged in a stack (as they are in order to constitute the first gathering), the different sizes of the leaves result in considerable portions of some pages being left uncovered by the preceding or succeeding leaf. Those portions left exposed exhibit discoloration.</p>

<p>Examples of the third pattern – discoloration only along one or more edges of the given page – appear much more often in the first gathering than examples of either of the first two patterns. Once more, careful comparative study of the various leaves of the first gathering suggests that the uneven size of Livingstone’s leaves has also produced this sequence of edge discoloration.</p>

<p class="space2"><a id="link4" name="link4"></a>As a result, the three patterns of discoloration in the first gathering differ predominantly in their extent on any given page rather than in any specific visual characteristics or, apparently, causal factors.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Second gathering</strong>. Because of the additional environmental marks present on the pages of the second gathering, discoloration in this case proves harder to define, to distinguish into patterns, and so, to explain. That the leaves of this gathering are disassembled further compounds the complexity as we can only guess or use reasonable inference to determine how the leaves were once arranged relative to one another.</p>

<p class="rteleft">Some leaves – particularly most of those from the David Livingstone Centre (1870h; 1871a:LXXVI [v.1], less so [LXXVI v.2]; and various pages in 1870j) – exhibit near ubiquitous discoloration. Others, i.e., the majority of leaves from the National Library of Scotland, show discoloration around one or more edges that – depending on the page – can gradually move inward towards the center and imperceptibly blend with what are clearly traces of other substances on the page.</p>

The dramatic difference in coloring between these two pages is due to the extensive discoloration of one page (LXVII, top) and not the other (LXIV, bottom).</span></p>

<p>As a result, the leaves of the second gathering offer little opportunity for causal analysis other than three general, but very rough observations.</p>

<p>1) Nearly all the surviving pages (1870e, 1870f, 1870i:XXI-LV [v.2]) that Livingstone wrote over leaves from the Stanley volume show discoloration along one or more edges, with the discoloration increasingly blending with the prominent central stain that appears later in the second sequence of pages (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link6">The big stain</a>; the blending begins circa 1870i:XLII and increases with each higher numbered page).</p>

<p>That this blending does occur suggests that all of the discoloration on these pages may be due as much to saturation as to exposure or even to a combination of the two. The same applies for all the pages that follow the stain (1870i:LVI-LXI, 1870k, but not 1870j), some of which also exhibit additional, more ubiquitous discoloration that must derive from another source.</p>

On this page, where processing enhances extensive saturation, it is difficult (if not impossible) to distinguish where such saturation ends and where discoloration along the edges of the page begins.</span></p>

<p>2) The pages that Livingstone wrote over the leaves from the Birdwood article (1871a, 1871b) exhibit a different kind of discoloration, with 1871a:LXXVI [v.1] and 1871b:LXXXVII serving, respectively, as the beginning and end of pages discolored in this way.</p>

<p>1871a:LXXVI [v.1], which is quite discolored throughout, appears on the back of the last leaf of the Birdwood article and would have been more exposed than the pages that follow (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link15">Additional Notes on the Undertexts</a>). 1871b:LXXXVII, the first page of the Birdwood article, would likewise have been exposed because of its place at the head of the article and, not surprisingly, this page too exhibits pervasive discoloration.</p>

<p>The pages that lie between these two endpoints (i.e., 1871a:LXXVI [v.1] and 1871b:LXXXVII) also bear similar, if slightly less pronounced discoloration. In most cases, the discoloration spills from the edges of the page towards the center of the page, exhibits a spectral response rather distinct from what are one or more additional substances on the pages, and in some cases also follows the vertical creasing of the pages (e.g., 1871b:LXXXII, LXXXIV, LXXXVI).</p>

This image underscores the highly uneven discoloration of this page, but in particular, in the center, shows how the discoloration follows the vertical creasing of the leaf.</span></p>

<p>3) The diary pages that Livingstone composed over the leaves of the <em>Pall Mall Budget </em>(1871e) exhibit the least amount of discoloration. These leaves, as preserved today, have been unfolded and flattened, but the discoloration clearly still follows the horizontal and vertical axis of the original folds on these leaves, as especially visible in our ICA_pseudo_1 images. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that this discoloration occurred at some point before the leaves were flattened.</p>

<p>In addition, this last point also highlights the caution necessary in studying any element of the diary because of the potentially invisible impact that different stage in the diary’s history may have had on the manuscript’s present state of preservation.</p>

<p class="space2">Whereas page discolor represents the end result of a longer term environmental process, staining – at least in the case of the 1870 Field Diary – appears tied to more instantaneous events. In particular, the manuscript of the diary shows that at specific moments Livingstone and/or others spilled various substances on the diary pages. In some cases, these substances – definitive identification of which lies outside the means of the present project team – interfere with Livingstone’s handwritten text;<a id="link6" name="link6"></a> in other cases, these substances lie below or over the text. The variety of stains and their impact on the visual characteristics of the 1870 Field Diary represent some of the most defining features of the manuscript.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>The big stain</strong>. This stain divides into two distinct segments:&nbsp; Visual inspection of the 1870 Field Diary coupled with reasonable inference suggests that at some point someone left the manuscript of the diary open at 1870i:LV [v.2] and LVI. This moment occurred after Livingstone had written his entries up to at least 1870i:LXI (the end of the letter to Lord Stanley, dated 15 November 1870), but before he passed away (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-1#link10">Reinking and Revision</a>).</p>

<p>Indeed, it’s possible that Livingstone himself had the manuscript open as he was copying over the letter to Lord Stanley, a circumstance that would also suggest that he first drafted the letter in his diary, then used that draft to produce the final version which he actually sent (<a href="/islandora/search?f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A&quot;1870&quot;&amp;f[]=addressee_ms%3A&quot;Stanley%2C+Lord%2C+1826-1893&quot;">Letter to Stanley</a>) – although these points move decidedly into the realm of conjecture.</p>

<p>When open, the relevant pages of the diary either covered the preceding stack of leaves (1870i:LV [v.2]) or the succeeding stack (1870i:LVI). Twine looped through the lower left-hand corner of 1870i:LV [v.2] may have held the former stack of leaves together, while the other stack was not bound, at least not in a way that is evident today (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/sections-1870-field-diary-edition/creating-1870-field-diary#link9">Fourth sub-gathering</a>). Finally, it seems that while open, the two stacks were arranged contiguously, 1870i:LV [v.2] farther from the reader and 1870i:LVI closer.</p>

The ASI combines a variety of individual processed spectral images in order to demonstrate the material complexity of the big stain.</span></p>

<p>While the manuscript occupied this state, someone spilled a liquid (water?) all over it, thereby heavily saturating the pages (1870i:XXXVII-LV [v.2] and, separately, 1870i:LVI-LXI). Our spectral images, which distinctly foreground the impact of this event (see PCA_pseudo_32,&nbsp;PCA_pseudo_34, and especially ICA_pseudo_32), enable review of the process of saturation at a level of detail not possible via the natural light images.</p>

<p>The water saturated all of 1870i:LVI in a fairly even pattern, then seeped through to the succeeding leaves, in an ever diminishing fashion, so that by page 1870i:LXI the water’s effects are minimal. The saturation caused the surface (recto) ink of 1870i:LVI to blot, the verso ink to bleed through to the recto (and vice-versa), and this process of blotting and bleed through to repeat on a lesser scale on the subsequent pages. (Note: Our pseudo_v4 and pseudo_v4_BY spectral images considerably diminish the effect of the blotting and bleed through, while the red_green images maximize the effect of the bleed through.)</p>

<p>The proximity of the two stacks of leaves at this moment proves hard to discern, but evidence suggests that the stacks were in closer contact on the left side than the right. As the water saturated 1870i:LVI, it also cascaded off the top of the page, then seeped between 1870i:LII and LIII of the other stack, heavily saturating them via a trajectory that started off-center at the edge of each of the pages (1870i:LII and LIII), then moved across the pages towards center of them.</p>

The animation of the odd-numbered pages in this sequence appears in our <a href="/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images">Notes on Processed Spectral Images</a>.</span></p>

<p>That trajectory has today left a stain on those pages in the shape of a comet with a rounded head at near the top of the pages (where the saturation stopped) and a wide tail at the bottom (where the saturation began as it seeped between the pages). Once between these two pages (1870i:LII and LIII), the water seeped upward through the stack to 1870i:LV [v.2] and downward all the way to 1870i:XXXVI, ultimately resulting in a kind of blotting and bleed-through of handwritten text similar to that seen on the stack of leaves covered by 1870i:LVI.</p>

<p class="space2">Although we suspect that this saturation is related both to the the large hole that runs concurrently with the first stack of pages (1870i:XXXVI-LV [v.2]; see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link8">Manuscript Holes</a>) and to the circular impression on 1870i:XXXV/XXXVI (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2#link5">Page Impressions</a>), which stands at the head of the page sequence in question, we lack the evidence to prove this conclusively.<a id="link7" name="link7"></a> Other questions also remain, including how we might account for the fact that the saturation occurred between two pages, one of which is the last to include the hole for twine, while the other has no such hole and, indeed, marks the start of a new set of source text pages.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Brown stains</strong>. The 1870 Field Diary bears a handful of other stain in addition to its most prominent stain. These additional stains decidedly represent secondary phenomena. Their characteristics prevent any kind of inference regarding the substances that made the stains or the causal relationship between the stains (if any), but study of each of the stain types does enable us to make a few remarks about them.</p>

<p>For instance, the 1870 Field Diary includes at least two different sets of brown stains, which seem not to be ink because their color often contrasts with the handwritten ink on the given page. One set appears on the right-hand side of 1871b:LXXVIII-LXXXVII (i.e., nearly all the leaves from the Birdwood article). Our ICA_pseudo_1 processed spectral images best bring these stains to the fore and present them as an irregular, dark orange or deep red blot.</p>

<p>These stains have seeped into the leaves from the edge of the page, where their mark is widest, then the stains narrow to a point as they move towards the center of the page. To a degree, these stains distort Livingstone’s writing and so may have occurred after he&nbsp;composed his entries. However, the evidence is inconclusive on this point, and it’s also possible that the presence of the stains on the page prevented the normal absorption of Livingstone’s ink into the page.</p>

<p>The second set of brown stains appears throughout the pages of the second gathering, and its presence follows no discernible pattern (instances appear on 1870e, 1870i:XXI-XXII, 1870j, 1871a:LXXVI [v.1], 1871e). The ICA_pseudo_1 images also best bring out this type of stain, whose color ranges between dark orange, fiery orange, and bright yellow in the processed images.</p>

<p class="space2">These brown stains, in contrast to the other set, generally takes a circular or roughly oval form and clearly occurred by a substance falling on the page from above. The stains can appear anywhere on the page and are generally small in size (equivalent to one or two of Livingstone’s handwritten characters).<a id="link8" name="link8"></a> The stains have no visible impact on Livingstone’s ink, and careful examination of the natural light images suggests that the stains lie below the ink and so pre-date it (for an exception see page 1871a:LXXVI [v.1]).</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Red stains</strong>. In addition to the brown stains, the 1870 Field Diary also contains at least one set of red stains. The red stains are even more common, with instances visible in both the first gathering (1870b:[1]-[4], [37]-[42], [55], [57], [59], [67]-[70]) and the second (1870e; 1870i:XXI-XXIV, XXXIII-XXXIV, XLIII-XLIV, LI-LVII, LX-LXI; 1870j; 1871a; 1871b:LXXVIII-LXXIX). In natural light, the stains take on a dark, rusty red color, while in ICA_pseudo_1 renderings they appear a solid red-orange shading into dark gray.</p>

<p>The red stains tend to be small, even smaller than the second set of brown stains (which, incidentally, often appear on the same pages as the red stains), and are of a circular character, which again suggests that some substance falling on the page produced the stains. The red stains also do not seem to have any impact on Livingstone’s ink and, again, seem to lie beneath the ink, at least as rendered in our images.</p>

Two of the stains clearly lie below the writing (and have no impact on it), are about the size or a quarter or silver dollar, circular (though the one at left has a series of jagged, star-like edges and so appears to have splattered on the page), and are either light brown (left stain) or faint orange (right stain) in natural light.</p>

An animated spectral image that highlights these stains appears in our essay on <a href="/spectral-imaging/prototyping-animated-spectral-images-asis">Prototyping Animated Spectral Images (ASIs)</a>.</span></p>

<p>The character of the third stain, which appears quite prominently in the upper left-hand corner of the page, differs considerably in that the stains is rectangular, jagged, very dark (dark brown to black), and completely covers and so hides Livingstone’s handwritten text. This stain resembles no other on the pages of the 1870 Field Diary.</p>

<p>A further set of unusual stains can be found on 1870h:XX. These stains run along the left, right, and bottom edges of the page, and vary in color and shape from elongated, asymmetrical orange-brown ovals (left-hand side) to progressively fainter and more jagged light brown circles (right-hand side).</p>

<p class="space2">Indeed, due to the variations in character, the stains may signal the presence of multiple substances and embody the end results of a more complex material history, as some of the stains clearly lie over Livingstone’s handwritten text and distort it, while others do not.<a id="link10" name="link10"></a> (Note: Two long, yellowish stains appears in the left margin of pages II and III, but a lack of spectral images for these pages prevents further study of the stains.)</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Invisible stains</strong>. Our processed spectral images have also revealed a series of remarkable stains that are not visible to the naked eye, at least through study of the natural light images, and, indeed, went previously unsuspected by the project team until discovered by chance when pursuing another spectral image processing objective. The stains are all present on or in the vicinity of page 1870h:XVII (one of the pages Livingstone composed on the back of Baker’s map) and are visible in either one or the other of two monochromatic processed images, IC4 and IC5.</p>

<p>One such stain, on IC5, appears to the left center of the page, is of an elongated cigar-like shape, and of a darkness comparable (at least in this rendering) to that of Livingstone’s handwritten text. The other, more dramatic set of stains can be seen in the IC4 rendering as a series of larger drops, darker at the edges than in the middle, ranging in size from quarter to dime, and arranged in a curving vertical line along the lower half of the page.</p>

<p>Although the project team can provide no further information about these invisible stains, their unexpected presence of the page in question points to a material history of the 1870 Field Diary as yet only glimpsed and so opens new frontiers for study of the diary’s pages.</p>

<p>In closing, three additional material features of the 1870 Field Diary require brief, additional comments. These features, which all relate to the construction of the diary or its source texts, do not fall into any of the other categories above.</p>

<p>First, the first gathering of the 1870 Field Diary (1870b) remains bound with twine. The twine, of course, can be studied in person at the David Livingstone Centre, where this gathering today resides, but also appears in the images of one page (1870b:[70]) plus in a recent photograph (2015) taken by one of the members of our project team of the diary on display in a museum case at the Centre (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/creating-1870-field-diary#link4">Gatherings</a>). This last photograph also shows the diverse sizes of the leaves of this gathering when stacked on top of one another and so supports the point made earlier about page discoloration in the first gathering due to the exposure of various pages or parts of pages (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-3#link3">First Gathering</a>).</p>

Used by permission.</em> Livingstone wrote this page of the 1870 Field Diary over a letter that, as seen here, still retains the original stamps used to send the letter to Livingstone in the first place.</span></p>

<p>Second, 1870c:IV, one of the four pages written over the letter from Gorbello[?], still retains the original three rectangular stamps (red, yellow, and green) used to mail the letter to Livingstone. There are also two postmarks over these stamps, both from Bombay and dated “[18]65” and “[18]66.”</p>

<p>Finally, the gutter edge of 1870i:XLVII and XLVIII still includes a segment of, apparently, the green adhesive that originally held these pages in the bound Stanley volume.</p>

<p class="rtecenter">*</p>

<p>Like ink and pencil marks on the page and elements of manuscript topography, environmental traces on the pages of the 1870 Field Diary provide insights into both unique moments and longer-term processes that have helped configuring this diary as it exists today. In the final part of this essay, we outline the previously documented history of the manuscript, then integrate the findings set out in this multi-part essay to produce a comprehensive new chronology of the diary.</p>

<p>Field Diary IV further develops two of Livingstone\'s main concerns: his relationship with his men and the Arab slave trade. The account is riddled with concerns over his authority and complaints about his porters\' behavior, including instances of rebellion and illnesses that Livingstone deems fake.</p>

<p>Livingstone most often singles out the sepoys and compares them unfavorably to his African porters, but there is one crime that all of his men seem to commit: stealing. At one point he refers to "a general stealing by the sepoys &amp; others" and concludes, "This is very distressing" (Livingstone 1866c:[53]). Indeed, the back of the diary includes a list of items stolen - including cloth, food, and gunpowder - and the perpetrator for each one (see below).</p>

<p>As Livingstone and his men make their way toward Lake Nyassa, he also notes the continued encroachment of the slave trade. Though he has fewer direct encounters than in <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-iii-overview">Field Diary III</a>, he finds a strong sense of the Arab influence on the African populations. For instance, he notes that the Waiyau people "imitate the Arabs in dress and chewing tobacco &amp; \'nora\' or lime instead of betel nut and lime" (Livingstone 1866c:[10]-[11]).</p>

<p>In addition, Livingstone describes and illustrates the huts in Mataka\'s village, which are built "square in the Arab fashion" (Livingstone 1866c:[28]). As in previous works, Livingstone also critiques the Africans for kidnapping and selling one another into slavery. He records the slave trade\'s atrocities, as evidenced by the image below, which depicts the bodies of slaves who were abandoned, tied to trees, on their march to the coast.</p>

<p>Yet, here we also find one of the primary tensions present in much of Livingstone\'s later writings: though he criticizes the African complicity with the slave trade, Livingstone, too, depends upon the Arabs. In the final section of the diary, he struggles to rent a dhow (a type of boat) from Arab traders, who first promise it to him but never furnish it, prompting him to turn unsuccessfully to a local headman: "Dhow people playing me false - afraid of me probably as all the slave traders have been" (Livingstone 1866c:[84]).</p>

<p>Livingstone requires the dhow because he has reached the shores of Lake Nyassa, the high point in this diary. He reports that it is "Pleasant to hear the roar of the sea and bathe in the rollers I feel exhilarated exhilarated [sic] as if I had come back to an old home which I did not expect again to see" (Livingstone 1866c:[67]). The food shortages experienced earlier on the trip are rectified here; "with milk," he concludes, "I feel \'in clover" (Livingstone 1866c:[73]).</p>

<p>Throughout the diary, Livingstone records a wealth of cultural, geographical, and agricultural information, including notes on personal decoration and facial features, local crops and cultivation methods, and topographical features. He is even moved to the poetic, describing, for instance, a "Mbanga village embowered in trees Euphorbias and wild fig trees" (Livingstone 1866c:[60])</p>

<p>Field Diary IV appears to be the same kind of book as the previous three field diaries: side-bound, covered in green silk that has become ragged with time. It is mainly written in grey pencil, with a few additions or corrections in blue pencil or black ink. As in previous diaries, Livingstone writes from both sides of the book at once, so the final twelve pages are written upside-down in relation to the rest of the text.</p>

<p>[Update note: Thanks to <a href="/about-site/what-leap-2013-2017">LEAP</a>, the <em>Livingstone Online</em> team has now converted the TEI P5 transcription of the 1871 Field Diary to our overall <a href="http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-ODD/leap.html" target="_blank">site encoding standards</a>. As a result, the encoding guidelines set out below are no longer valid, but are provided&nbsp;for reference purposes only. Additionally, this page remains a useful record of Livingstone\'s authorial practices in composing the text of the 1871 Field Diary.]</p>

<p><!--Insert first paragraph-->We have transcribed and encoded the text of David Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary into XML according to the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/" target="_blank">P5 Guidelines</a> of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Our encoding practices also draw on the original tagging guidelines developed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Livingstone Online</span> [no longer available online], although we have introduced a variety of modifications and have updated these guidelines from TEI P4 to TEI P5. Finally, our work is also indebted to the advice of Lisa McAulay, the Librarian for Digital Collection Development in the UCLA Digital Library Program; James Cummings, Manager of InfoDev, University of Oxford; and Doug Emery, our data manager.</p>

<p>Each XML document we have produced contains two major structural elements: the header and the text. A summary of the tagging practices used for both of these of elements follows. Note: in the text below “folio” refers to one side of a leaf of Livingstone’s diary, whereas "page" may denote all or only a portion of that folio. In all cases, a leaf of Livingstone’s diary contains two folia (one on the recto side, the other on the verso), while a folio may contain either one or two diary pages.</p>

<p><a name="link1"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>I. File Naming</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span></h4>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">first segment</span> consists of the initials of the institution holding this portion of the diary followed by the institutional shelfmark, as in the following example, where "DLC" stands for the David Livingstone Centre and "297c" represents the shelfmark:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">DLC297c_105-130_002v_TEI.xml</p>

<p>The <em>second segment</em> indicates Livingstone’s own page number(s), if provided. Roman numerals have been changed to Arabic numerals to ease reading. For any portions of the diary where Livingstone does not provide page numbers, we have numbered the folia consecutively beginning with 001, with the same number being used for the recto and verso:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">NLS10703_001_036r_TEI.xml<br />
NLS10703_001_039v_TEI.xml<br />
NLS10703_002_037r_TEI.xml<br />
NLS10703_002_038v_TEI.xml</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">third segment</span> indicates the institutional page number(s), if provided. In addition, this segment includes the letter "r" (recto) or "v" (verso). For any portions of the diary lacking institutional page numbers, we have numbered the folia consecutively beginning with 001, with the same number being used for the recto and verso:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">DLC1120b_001r_001r_TEI.xml<br />
DLC1120b_001v_001v_TEI.xml</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">fourth segment</span> indicates that the given folio of the diary has been transcribed according to TEI P5 guidelines by the presence of the "TEI" acronym:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">DLC1120b_001_001r_TEI.xml</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">extension</span> ".xml" on all the example file names above indicates that each is an XML document.</p>

&lt;p&gt;David Livingstone writes his diary entries over a portion of a page from The Standard (London). Livingstone\'s "overtext" is what is transcribed and represented in Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 XML encoding. In addition, this folio includes the number "10" written in pencil at the top center of the page in a second, unknown hand&lt;/p&gt;<br />

<p>The document header is thus divided into four main sections, all of which are contained within the &lt;teiHeader&gt; element (&lt;fileDesc&gt;, &lt;encodingDesc&gt;, &lt;profileDesc&gt;, &lt;revisionDesc&gt;) and each of these, in turn, contains a variety of subsections.<a name="link3"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A. &lt;fileDesc&gt;</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p class="space2"><a name="link4"></a>The &lt;fileDesc&gt; element records the description of the original document and digital file. This element contains three major sections:</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>1. &lt;titleStmt&gt;</strong></p>

<p>This element gives the title, author, and editor of the file. Since the 1871 Field Diary is part of the Manyema Field Diary, we use the latter rather than the former title in all of our files [Update note: This naming practice has since been discontinued]. This element also includes the date of the original document, Livingstone’s page numbers (where available) in Arabic numerals, and the first three segments of the file name (see <a href="#link1">File Naming</a>, above).<a name="link5"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>2. &lt;publicationStmt&gt;</strong></p>

<p>This element describes how, where, when, and by whom our transcription is being published. The element also provides the rights and conditions of use.<a name="link6"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>3. &lt;sourceDesc&gt;</strong></p>

<p>This element describes the original source, including the collection in which it is held and the shelfmark as well as bibliographical details of Livingstone’s "undertext." We include the &lt;sealDesc&gt; and &lt;seal&gt; elements only if the original document contains a seal.<a name="link7"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>B. &lt;encodingDesc&gt;</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p>The &lt;encodingDesc&gt; element describes the relationship between the transcription and the original document. This element contains the &lt;projecpesc&gt; which records our encoding objectives, including a description of those features of the original documents that were and were not encoded. In general, our practice has been to encode any text written by Livingstone in the Body Text (see below), while transcribing (but not encoding) any text by other hands within the &lt;projecpesc&gt;. Finally, the &lt;projecpesc&gt; also contains information about material characteristics of Livingstone’s original manuscript and how these relate to the "undertext."<a name="link8"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>C. &lt;profileDesc&gt;</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p>The &lt;profileDesc&gt; element contains classificatory information about the text, including the languages included.<a name="link9"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>D. &lt;revisionDesc&gt;</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p>The &lt;revisionDesc&gt; element describes the file\'s revision history. This element contains information describing all the actions undertaken by the editorial team, such as when and by whom a folio was transcribed and proofread. Each of these separate actions are enclosed within a &lt;change&gt; element containing detailed information on the action taken and the individual responsible for it. The &lt;date&gt; element here contains dates in the yyyy-mm-dd format.<a name="link9.5"></a></p>

<p><strong>E. &lt;facsimile&gt;&lt;surface&gt;&lt;graphic&gt;&lt;zone&gt;</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p>These elements are dynamically inserted into the file (directly after the &lt;teiHeader&gt; element) and assist in linking the transcription, line by line, to the corresponding areas of the registered spectral images.</p>

<h4><strong>III. Body Text</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span></span> ⤴</a></span><a name="link12"></a></h4>

<p style="padding-top: 6px;"><strong>A. Major Structural Elements</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>1. &lt;text&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We record the transcribed text of each folio of Livingstone’s diary within the &lt;text&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt; elements. Each XML file contains only one &lt;div&gt; element, even if the given folio contains two of Livingstone’s numbered pages.<a name="link13"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>2. &lt;ab&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We use the &lt;ab&gt; element to mark up portions of text that appear alongside but are not clearly related to the diary entries on a given page of Livingstone’s manuscript (see DLC297c_133-102_001r_TEI and DLC297b_151-144_011r_TEI for examples).</p>

<p>We also use the &lt;ab&gt; element to mark a few parts of the manuscript where Livingstone writes over his own writing, in effect producing "undertext" (DLC297b_133-162_005v, DLC297c_111-124_005v) and "overtext" (DLC297c_121-114_007r). In these case, the &lt;ab&gt; element takes both the @rend and the @xml:id attributes, each with a value of layered-text. Except for the first instance (see below), which covers a significant amount of text, we do not encode the second layer of text in any way.</p>

<p>The &lt;ab&gt; element is contained within the &lt;div&gt; element when used for the foregoing purposes.<a name="link14"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>3. &lt;cb/&gt;</strong></p>

<p>In one instance, we use the &lt;cb/&gt; element to mark the beginning of a significant portion of "overtext" that Livingstone writes at a perpendicular angle to the rest of the diary entries on the page (DLC297b_133-162_005v). In this case, the &lt;cb/&gt; element also takes the @corresp attribute with a value of #layered-text.<a name="link15"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>4. &lt;milestone&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We use the &lt;milestone&gt; element to mark:</p>

<p>a. The beginning of each folio:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;milestone unit="folio" n="001r"/&gt;</p>

<p>The @n attribute indicates the institutional page number (see <a href="#link1">File Naming</a>, above) and whether this is the recto or verso.</p>

<p>b. The beginning of each diary page:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;milestone unit="page" n="CII"/&gt;</p>

<p>The @n attribute records Livingstone’s original page number or, if not provided, a sequential page number (1, 2, 3, etc.) assigned by us. This latter practice, however, only applies to the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods#link7">Additional Diary Pages</a>, which were not assigned Roman numerals by Livingstone.</p>

<p>c. The beginning of each column of text on those folia that have more than one column of text but have not been provided individual page numbers by Livingstone (e.g., DLC1120b_001r_001r) or on numbered pages that contain two or more adjacent columns of text on a single page (e.g., DLC297c_105-130_002v):</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;milestone unit="column" n="1"/&gt;</p>

<p>The @n attribute specifies the column number.</p>

<p>The &lt;milestone&gt; element is also used to mark where a portion of text with multiple columns ends:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;milestone unit="endColumns"/&gt;</p>

<p>d. The horizontal line(s) Livingstone draws across his diary pages to separate individual diary entries:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;milestone unit="section" rend="line"/&gt;</p>

<p>The @rend attribute specifies the number of lines Livingstone has drawn. Values used include: half-line (to mark a line that only goes halfway across the page), line, 2 lines.<a name="link16"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>5. &lt;fw&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We record Livingstone’s headers and, in one case (DLC297c_131-104_002r), the footer within the &lt;fw&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;fw n="heading_CXXIV"&gt;CXXIV Journal &lt;/fw&gt;</p>

<p>The @n attribute specifies that this is a heading and denotes Livingstone’s original Roman numeral. We use the &lt;fw&gt; element to encode Livingstone’s original page number and the words "Journal" or "Note" (which Livingstone typically includes at the top of each diary page). We record any succeeding dates within a separate &lt;p&gt; element.</p>

<p>The exceptions to this practice are as follows. In two instances where Livingstone places the word "Journal" on a line other than the first line of the page (DLC297b_159-136_007r, DLC1120b_001r_001r), we do not encode the word as part of the &lt;fw&gt; element but rather treat it as part of the first dated diary entry on the page. In two other instances (DLC297c_113-122_006v, DLC297c_115-120_007v), we include a date that marks the opening of a new diary entry in the &lt;fw&gt; element because the date appears between Livingstone’s Roman numeral and the word "Journal."<a name="link17"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>6. &lt;p&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We encode each of Livingstone’s paragraphs within the &lt;p&gt; element. Typically, the &lt;p&gt; start-tag is followed by the date for a new diary entry. If, at the beginning of a diary page, the date follows the words "Journal" or "Note" and represents the beginning of a new diary entry it is encoded within the &lt;p&gt; element. We use the &lt;p&gt; end-tag at the end of the diary page, even if the last paragraph continues to the next folio/page.<a name="link18"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>7. &lt;lb/&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We use the &lt;lb/&gt; element to mark the beginning of each line of text:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;lb n="1"/&gt;</p>

<p>The @n attribute indicates the line number. We number each line on each diary page, including the line that includes the &lt;fw&gt; element regardless of whether the &lt;fw&gt; element takes up all or just part of the line.</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #1</span><br />

&lt;lb n="2"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canoes were jammed in a creek at<br />
&lt;lb n="3"/&gt;the bottom of the market place</p>

<p>Line numbering on any given page is continuous, except for text contained within the &lt;ab&gt; element, where the line numbering is restarted.</p>

<p>When we encode two columns of adjacent text on a numbered diary page using the &lt;milestone&gt; element, we continue the line numbering from column to column:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;lb n="19"/&gt;&lt;milestone unit="column" n="1"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;date when="1871-04-01"&gt;Monday<br />

<p>We do not assign a separate line number to any text added by Livingstone above or below the line of text proper:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;lb n="2"/&gt;what the Egyptians priests &lt;add place="below"&gt;^&lt;/add&gt; &lt;add place="above"&gt;learned men&lt;/add&gt; of remote antiquity</p>

<p>Finally, we dynamically insert the @facs attribute into each &lt;lb/&gt; element in order to help link the given line of text to the corresponding area of the relevant spectral images.<a name="link44"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>8. &lt;w&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We use the &lt;w&gt; element to mark words that Livingstone breaks up over two lines. We also add the @break with the value of no to the &lt;lb/&gt; that falls between the two halves of the word. Livingstone\'s use of hyphens is erratic. Sometimes he hyphenates a word at the end of the first line, sometimes at the beginning of the second, sometimes in both places, sometimes in neither. We code each of these instances in the same way, but we also always supply a hyphen at the end of the line if Livingstone himself has failed to provide it.</p>

<p><strong>B. Textual Layout and Formatting</strong><span style="font-size:14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: crimson text;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents"><span style="font-family: source sans pro;">Top</span> ⤴</a></span></span></p>

<p style="padding-top: 4px;"><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>1. &lt;space/&gt; and Spacing between Words</strong></p>

<p>a. We record the presence of an unusual space between words using the &lt;space/&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;space dim="horizontal" extent="5" unit="chars"/&gt;</p>

<p>The @extent attribute represents an approximation of character spaces between words. We have tagged all unusual spaces between words, whether the spaces appear to have semantic value or not:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #1</span><br />
which the &lt;space dim="horizontal" extent="2" unit="chars"/&gt; ancients may not have</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #2</span><br />
the general level &lt;space dim="horizontal" extent="3" unit="chars"/&gt;It is covered with</p>

<p>In one instance (DLC297c_103-132_001v), we also record an unusual space between lines using the &lt;space&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;space dim="vertical" extent="1" unit="lines"/&gt;</p>

<p>However, in general we do not record unusual spaces at the beginning of manuscript lines, unless these spaces mark the opening of a new diary entry or paragraph. Although Livingstone attempts to write his text flush left, he is not always successful in this endeavor and, additionally, is sometimes forced to follow the ragged contours of his diary pages. We believe the effort needed to represent such highly erratic and inconsistent spacing practices would not be worth the benefit to be gained.</p>

<p>b. Any space between the material contained in the &lt;fw&gt; element and the &lt;p&gt; element is recorded within the &lt;fw&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;fw n="heading_CXXXIX"&gt;CXXXIX Journal = &lt;/fw&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;date when="1871-06-20"&gt;20&lt;hi rend="sup;ul"&gt;th&lt;/hi&gt; June 1871&lt;/date&gt; - Two</p>

<p>Otherwise, the space at the beginning of a paragraph is always recorded with the &lt;space/&gt; element and within the &lt;p&gt; element, even if the space is only the extent of one character:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;space dim="horizontal" extent="1" unit="chars"/&gt;&lt;date when="1871-06-29"&gt;29&lt;hi rend="ul;sup"&gt;th&lt;/hi&gt;&lt;/date&gt; &lt;persName&gt;Manilla&lt;/persName&gt;\'s foray burns ten</p>

<p>c. Livingstone’s spacing before and after the n-dash and the equal sign (=), his two main forms of punctuation, is highly erratic. At times he places a space before and/or after these characters, sometimes not. Our practice has been to place one space before and one space after these characters in every instance, unless the presence of a larger space necessitates the use of the &lt;space/&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #1</span><br />
large goat = &lt;foreign xml:lang="und"&gt;lokolia&lt;/foreign&gt; colour or skin - Horns</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #2</span><br />
palm oil - fowls - &lt;space dim="horizontal" extent="2" unit="chars"/&gt;Each is intensely in</p>

<p>In encoding a few instances where Livingstone uses a particularly long dash, we have used a series of three n-dashes. We have placed a space before and after the series, but have not inserted spaces between the individual n-dashes:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">30 feet of depth at flood --- which</p>

<p>However, no space has been placed before an n-dash if it is used to hyphenate a word at the end of a line or at the beginning of a line:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;lb n="16"/&gt;by which the irresponsible con-<br />
&lt;lb n="17"/&gt;-clave brought the Indian command</p>

<p>d. On occasion Livingstone introduces or closes a citation by using quotation marks directly over an n-dash. In these cases we transcribe this as an n-dash directly succeeded or preceded by a quotation mark, without any intervening spaces:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">sold it -"It is an ill wind that blows no body good"- Thanks to the<a name="link21"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>2. &lt;hi&gt;</strong></p>

<p>We record textual formatting using the &lt;hi&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">of &lt;hi rend="ul"&gt;vanilla&lt;/hi&gt; pods which the natives mix</p>

<p>The values we use for the @rend attribute include: sup (superscript), ul (underline), double-underline, overbar (overline), sc (small caps), cap (capital letters), vertical-line (for text that Livingstone writes perpendicularly to the rest of the text on the page), circled (for text Livingstone has circled, usually when editing). Multiple values are separated with a semicolon:</p>

<p>We use the &lt;add&gt; element to record additions made to the manuscript by Livingstone himself:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">your Lordship that &lt;add place="below"&gt;^&lt;/add&gt; &lt;add place="above"&gt;at last&lt;/add&gt; I have succeeded in</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, Livingstone marks the place of addition with a caret, which is recorded as above. The values we use for the @place attribute include: above, below, inline, marginright, marginleft, overright, overleft, subbelow, subright, subleft, supabove, supright, supleft, underright, underleft.</p>

<p>(Note: when an addition appears between lines, below or above the line of text to which it, the addition, has been added, the @place attribute takes the value of below or above. If the addition appears in the previous or next line or any preceding or subsequent line, the @place attribute takes the values of subbelow, subright, subleft, supabove, supright, or supleft. If an addition is overtext or undertext, the @place attribute takes the values of overright, overleft, underright, or underleft.)</p>

<p>If Livingstone deletes one or more characters by writing over them, we note the addition directly after the deletion, as in the following example:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">foray - &lt;del&gt;The&lt;/del&gt;&lt;add place="inline"&gt;We&lt;/add&gt; met the horde<a name="link24"></a></p>

<p class="rteindent1">putting between the &lt;del type="cancelled"&gt;object&lt;/del&gt; lenses of the object</p>

<p>The @type attribute indicates the type of deletion, either strikethrough (a single line) or cancelled (multiple lines). If Livingstone deletes text by writing over it, we do not use an @type attribute.</p>

<p>We tag all personal names (including all titles) using the &lt;persName&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #1</span><br />
&lt;persName&gt;Dugumbe&lt;/persName&gt;</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #2</span><br />
&lt;persName&gt;Lord Palmerston&lt;/persName&gt;<a name="link37"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>2. Tribes and Villagers</strong></p>

<p>We tag African tribes and villagers with the &lt;term&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;term type="tribe"&gt;Bagenya&lt;/term&gt;</p>

<p>The @type attribute values in this case include: tribe, villagers. (Note: Livingstone uses "Manyema" to refer either to the tribe or the region, so our coding of this word always depends on context.) [Update note: Further research has shown that "Manyema" is actually a collective term that embraces the many ethnic groups residing in the eponymous region. As a result, it is now <em>Livingstone Online</em> practice to tag this word with &lt;orgName&gt; rather than &lt;term type="tribe"&gt;.] <a name="link38"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>3. Places and Geographical Entities</strong></p>

<p>We tag all places and geographical entities with the &lt;placeName&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;placeName&gt;&lt;geogName type="river"&gt;Nile&lt;/geogName&gt;&lt;/placeName&gt;</p>

<p>We also tag all place names and geographical entities when used in an adjectival form:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;placeName&gt;&lt;settlement type="village"&gt;Ujiji&lt;/settlement&gt;&lt;/placeName&gt;an slaves</p>

<p>Nested tags, which we always use, include the following:</p>

<p>a. &lt;bloc&gt; to denote a large entity like Africa</p>

<p>b. &lt;region&gt; to denote a region like East Africa or Zanzibar. (Note: Livingstone uses "Manyema" to refer either to the tribe or the region, so our coding of this word always depends on context.)</p>

<p>c. &lt;country&gt; to denote a country like England</p>

<p>d. &lt;settlement&gt; to denote cities, town, villages, and other settlements:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;placeName&gt;&lt;settlement type="village"&gt;Nyangwe&lt;/placeName&gt;&lt;/settlement&gt;</p>

<p>The @type attribute values in this case include: city, town, village.</p>

<p>e. &lt;geogName&gt; to denote geographical entities not covered by the above. The @type attribute values in this case include: river, lake, feature. For entities not covered by these values or in cases of uncertainty the @type attribute is not used:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;placeName&gt;&lt;geogName&gt;Kalahari Desert&lt;/geogName&gt;&lt;/placeName&gt;<a name="link39"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>4. Dates</strong></p>

<p>We tag all dates using the &lt;date&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;date when="1871-05-20"&gt;20th May 1871&lt;/date&gt;</p>

<p>The value of the @when attribute takes the following format: yyyy-mm-dd. Although Livingstone does not always include the year and/or month when recording dates, we include these in the value when known:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;date when="1871-05-31"&gt;31&lt;hi rend="sup;ul"&gt;st&lt;/hi&gt;&lt;/date&gt;</p>

<p>Likewise, we code any other temporal information provided by Livingstone within the &lt;date&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #1</span><br />
&lt;date when="1871-04-01"&gt;Monday 1&lt;hi rend="sup;ul"&gt;st&lt;/hi&gt; April 1871&lt;/date&gt;</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #2</span><br />
&lt;date when="1870-11"&gt;November last year&lt;/date&gt;</p>

<p>We also code dates from the Arab calendar when Livingstone provides them by using the @calendar and the value of Muslim:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;date calendar="Muslim"&gt;Arab fifth month&lt;/date&gt;</p>

<p>Finally, in a few instances, Livingstone begins diary entries with the time rather than the date. In these cases we also use the &lt;date&gt; element rather than the &lt;time&gt; element, but give the @when attribute a value that includes the time:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;date when="1871-07-16T13:00:00"&gt;1 PM&lt;/date&gt;<a name="link40"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>5. Medical References</strong></p>

<p>We code medical references using the &lt;term&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #1</span><br />
&lt;term type="medicament"&gt;Quinine&lt;/term&gt;</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example #2</span><br />
&lt;term type="ailment"&gt;dysentery&lt;/term&gt;</p>

<p>The @type attribute values in this case include: ailment, medicament, bodypart, bodyprocess.<a name="link41"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>6. Foreign Words and Phrases</strong></p>

<p>We code foreign words and phrases, except for those in Hebrew or Arabic, using the &lt;foreign&gt; element:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;foreign xml:lang="und"&gt;chitoka&lt;/foreign&gt;</p>

<p>We use the @xml:lang attribute to identify foreign languages. The following values are used in our transcription of Livingstone’s diary: en (English), swh (Swahili), la (Latin). If the African language quoted by Livingstone is unknown, we use: und (Undetermined African Language). Any languages used by Livingstone are also recorded in the &lt;profileDesc&gt; in the document header (see above). For Hebrew and Arabic, see the next section below.<a name="link42"></a></p>

<p class="space-2">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>7. Drawings, Maps, Calculations, Seals, Squiggles, Foreign Text (Hebrew/Arabic)</strong></p>

<p>Livingstone’s manuscript contains a number of drawings, maps, calculations, seals, and squiggles to correct ink flow. We never encode any part of these, but rather note their presence and describe them using the &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figDesc&gt; elements:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figDesc&gt;Livingstone records a series of calculations on the left-hand side of the page.&lt;/figDesc&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>We also dynamically insert the @facs attribute to help link the &lt;figure&gt; to the corresponding area of the relevant spectral images.</p>

<p>In three instances (DLC297c_111-124_005v, DLC297c_121-114_007r, NLS10703_002_038v), we also encode bits of Hebrew, Arabic, Nagari text, some of which may not be in Livingstone’s hand, using the &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figDesc&gt; elements.</p>

<p>The presence of a seal is also noted in the &lt;sealDesc&gt; element in the <a href="#link6">document header</a>.<a name="link43"></a></p>

Through Livingstone’s writings, students can explore many important nineteenth-century issues that continue to resonate in our own time.</p>

<p>Using our series of <a href="/resources/livingstone-online-outreach-worksheets">eleven educational worksheets</a>, teachers can cover topics ranging from abolition and global citizenship to the industrial revolution and African animals. The materials also encourage students to explore <em>Livingstone Online</em><em> </em>on their own. Through these resources, students can better understand the historical and cultural impact of David Livingstone’s nineteenth-century life and travels in Britain, Africa, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Each worksheet takes as its starting point a letter, diary entry, or piece of text by Livingstone, through which students can explore a specific topic in depth. For instance, students might read an excerpt of a letter Livingstone sent to a friend in order to learn about nineteenth-century expeditions and how maps were made. Students are encouraged not only to answer the questions posed on each worksheet but also to discuss the wider issues surrounding each topic, including its relevance in their own lives and in contemporary geopolitics.</p>

<p>During the second half of 1870, David Livingstone was at a particularly low point. His mission to find the source of the Nile had become an “obsession,”&nbsp;in the words of his biographer Tim Jeal, “a compensation for every other failure” (Jeal 2013:367). Yet, despite his sense of urgency, Livingstone was stranded in Bambarre, a village in Central Africa, and was unable to travel due to illness and flesh-eating ulcers on his feet.</p>

<p>Depressed and isolated, Livingstone spent much of this time waiting for a box to arrive from Ujiji that contained medicine, food, letters from Europe, and – crucially – paper on which to record his observations. The manuscripts in which he recorded his thoughts during this time offer a unique perspective both on Livingstone’s own self-presentation and on the historical frameworks scholars have used to interpret Livingstone’s composition practices.</p>

<p>Until the box arrived, Livingstone kept two primary records. The first, Field Diary XIII (28 June 1869-25 Feb. 1871), was the last of a supply of small stenographer-style notebooks Livingstone had been filling up since 1866. Small, with the spine at the top, this notebook was primarily used to scrawl shorter notes, often in pencil. The second, the 1870 Field Diary (17 Aug. 1870-22 Mar. 1870), was constructed from other printed materials Livingstone had on hand and made in stages, perhaps because Livingstone held out hope of receiving more paper.</p>

Livingstone covered the back of the map with text, but left the map itself unmarked except for a small segment with calculations in the lower left-hand corner. The segment also includes an addition (upside-down) in another hand.</span></p>

<p>To create the 1870 Field Diary, Livingstone first cut off the margins a periodical article and fastened these together to create a little booklet of 35 leaves. Then, with no paper forthcoming, he wrote over an old letter, three leaves from a printed book, and one or more texts that have not survived. He then turned to a large map as his source of paper. Finally, he tore out 34 leaves from a variety of publications and wrote crosswise over the printed text. In February 1871, Livingstone finally received supplies from the coast, including food and some new publications. The 1870 Field Diary thus concludes with some pages written over the Pall Mall Budget, while the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0">1871 Field Diary</a> continues on a copy of <em>The Standard</em>.</p>

<p>It was not until much later that Livingstone once more gained access to his third record, one that gives us our final account of this period. The Unyanyembe Journal (28 Jan. 1866-5 Mar. 1872), a large volume with ruled pages and bound in leather, was stored in the village of Ujiji. When Livingstone returned to Ujiji (as he did in the fall of 1871), he copied over entries from the first two records, Field Diary XIII and the 1870 Field Diary, into the Unyanyembe Journal.</p>

<p>After his death, Livingstone’s final writings were edited by his friend Horace Waller and published in two volumes as the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874). For this period, however, Waller primarily relied on the 1870 Field Diary rather than the Unyanyembe Journal (his default text in preparing the <em>Last Journals</em>). As a result, when we take the 1870 Field Diary, the Unyanyembe Journal, and Field Diary XIII together, we can create a more diverse, patchworked record of the period July 1870 - March 1871, the time when Livingstone was stranded in Bambarre and also the time directly pre-dating his <a href="http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/1871diary/livingstone2.htm" target="_blank">visit to Nyangwe</a>.</p>

<p>Scholars have typically characterized Livingstone’s composition practices according to a three-stage model. This model, devised by Roy C. Bridges, outlines the process by which the text of Livingstone (and other explorers like him) moved from field observations to published texts. The first stage, according to Bridges, might include “immediate observations recorded day by day in notebooks [ . . . ] often together with sketches, calculations, vocabularies and jottings noting some of / the things that have been preoccupying him” (Bridges 1977:3-4).</p>

<p>The second stage would be a secondary journal, like the Unyanyembe Journal, which “omitted, amended or expanded the material in the notebooks,” as well as letters in which Livingstone often reworked his accounts (Bridges 1977:4). Finally, the third stage included revisions by editors, family, and publishers and ultimately became the basis of the published accounts - popular and scientific - of the given expedition.</p>

<p>The earliest writing is, in this framework, the least mediated, or as Bridges terms it, “the ‘raw’ record,” meaning that we should consult this version to get the least filtered account of contact narratives (Bridges 1998:70). Of course, as Bridges’s scare quotes suggest, no record is completely unmediated, but nonetheless, scholars have tended to read each successive stage as a rewriting of the one before. In this reading, as Ian MacLaren describes it, the movement from stage to stage becomes a process of “editing of parallel or variorum editions of narratives” (MacLaren 1992:61).</p>

<p>The final texts, therefore, are not only the result of a professional editor; Livingstone and other explorers self-censored as each stage went by, editing out the descriptive details about daily life and other information from their field diaries. The effect in Livingstone’s case, Dorothy Helly argues, is that, as we move through the manuscript stages, we lose the texture of Livingstone’s daily life, an argument that contributes to our understanding of the field diaries as the most “‘raw,’” as Bridges puts it. Helly concludes, “If we compare those daily field notes with his finished journal, we understand how Livingstone decided to present his activities” (Helly 1987:151).</p>

<p>From July to February of 1870, however, we have a period whose records pose an exception to this characterization of the typical explorer writing practices. Because of his limited supplies, Livingstone created a first-stage document (Field Diary XIII) that is largely self-enclosed and not developed further.</p>

<p>The 1870 Field Diary falls somewhere between the first and second stages, as it is often the first record of an event, but it does also sometimes revise and expand upon events jotted down in Field Diary XIII. However, many parts of the 1870 Field Diary never went through a second stage before being published as<em> </em>the <em>Last Journals</em>. The Unyanyembe Journal, usually Livingstone’s second-stage document, was unavailable to Livingstone and therefore bears only a few accounts from this period.</p>

<p>Neither Field Diary XIII nor the 1870 Field Diary, then, fit neatly into the typical three-stage model, suggesting that at this difficult stretch of his life, Livingstone followed an atypical model in mediating and amending his thoughts. Far from being a raw record, for instance, the 1870 Field Diary shows Livingstone already planning future publications – though perhaps in a more critical vein than circumstances ultimately permitted.</p>

<p>Entries in the handmade 1870 Field Diary tend to be longer and more sporadic, while Field Diary XIII, which Livingstone apparently composed concurrently, appears to keep track of dates and use shorter notations. As this was the last of the small stenographer notebooks that Livingstone had with him, he dramatically reduced his entries, presumably as he realized that he could not access the box in Ujiji.</p>

<p>Livingstone shifted from longer entries in the beginning of the notebook (June 1869-Aug. 1870) to short notations as he began to run out of space. He began using the notebook primarily to keep track of dates, often lining up the date numbers until something occurred that he deemed noteworthy. Instead of filling an entire page with one day, he shifted to recording the dates of many days, with only a scrawled word or two next to select dates. For instance, one line from August 1870 reads, “18th 19th high wind 20th 21st 22nd trowsers [sic] red made Susi idle.”</p>

<p>Events that Livingstone records in three separate phases, that is, in the two diaries and the journal, tend to be local events, especially illnesses, Manyema conflicts, and Livingstone’s frustrations with his own men. First he records an event in Field Diary XIII, then expands upon in the 1870 Field Diary and, later, revisits (and revises) it in the Unyanyembe Journal.</p>

The page at top sets out Livingstone\'s observations on safura, a disease that involves eating earth, now known as pica or geophagy.</span></p>

<p>For instance, he briefly records “safura or clay eating” in Field Diary XIII (29 Nov. 1870). On the same date, he expands this in the 1870 Field Diary to a long entry on the “disease [of] clay or earth eating at Zanzibar,” noting that this affected slaves as well as pregnant Manyema woman. He concludes that “[s]afura is thus a disease per se” rather than some kind of attempt at suicide and so he feels “content” to wait until his medicines arrive so that he might try to augment the local cure of purging and fasting (Livingstone 1870j:LXIII).</p>

<p>The version he later recorded in the Unyanyembe Journal retains the medical evidence but edits out his own thoughts on potential cures, adding instead this anecdote: “Muhamad\'s brother was attacked and his wife told him of it on enquiry his brother was ashamed &amp; denied it but his wife repeated - it is false he is constantly picking out earth out of the garden wall or little clods on the surface and eating them” (Livingstone 1866-72:[621]). In this instance, the 1870 Field Diary becomes more of an add-on to Field Diary XIII, expanding on something Livingstone noted but did not have the space to elucidate. The Unyanyembe Journal then revises it for a wider audience, removing Livingstone’s medical notes and adding more local color.</p>

<p>This three-stage development – traditionally seen as typical for Livingstone – is actually unusual for these manuscripts. Instead, we see a variety of approaches, which treat Field Diary XIII and the 1870 Field Diary documents with varying purposes, rather than as the first- and second-stage documents described above. Some pieces of information appear only briefly in Field Diary XIII and nowhere else. Livingstone uses Field Diary XIII to record payments; once a month for August, September, and October 1870, he notes “beads” or “gave beads.” He also uses Field Diary XIII to record agricultural practices. For instance, on 23 December 1870, he writes “rice coming into ear,” while on 26 January 1871, he observes that the Manyema “planted beans &amp; maize.”</p>

<p>Finally, he uses Field Diary XIII to keep track of comings and goings, noting when his men go out to find food and when they return, citing points such as, “Safari left today” (19 Oct. 1870) or “Nyumbo up Tombatu islet” (3 Nov. 1870). This is the daily business of being an explorer and provides important details from the life of someone conducting an expedition with hired labor and relying on local food sources. Livingstone never expanded upon or recopied much such information into other documents, at least in this stage in his travels.</p>

<p>Other kinds of information might warrant a brief entry in Field Diary XIII and then a revision or expansion in the 1870 Field Diary without being carried over to the Unyanyembe Journal. For example, in Field Diary XIII, Livingstone writes “Muenimgoi steals a captive and sells her back to Mocnemohia for 30 spears” (1 Nov. 1870). An entry in the 1870 Field Diary dated one day earlier, 31 October 1870, expands this event into a lengthy paragraph, explaining how Monangoi fits into the local kinship and governance networks. He laments the acceptance of what we would now call human trafficking, noting, “When asked about this captive he said ‘she died’ – It was simply theft – but he does not consider himself bad” (Livingstone 1870h:XIX). In this way, the 1870 Field Diary functions as a second-stage document, a place to expand upon events merely noted before and repackage them with Livingstone’s own interpretation.</p>

<p>In one instance, Livingstone even uses the 1870 diary for both first and second stages within the same diary. A draft copy of a letter to Lord Stanley appears in the middle of the second gathering of pages and summarizes Livingstone’s travels to-date in Manyema (Livingstone 1870i:XLI-LXI). In doing so, the letter offers a revised version of the narratives of both the first gathering and the second gathering up to the point where the letter appears. The result is a document integral to the diary that at the same time embodies a new stage of revision. This suggests that Livingstone doesn’t necessarily see each diary as a discrete manuscript but rather envisions a more fluid temporal relationship both among the diaries and even within them.</p>

<p>Most often, the 1870 Field Diary works like another first-stage document, recording new material alongside Field Diary XIII rather than amplifying it. Moreover, because of Livingstone’s atypical method in this case of carrying over passages from the 1870 Field Diary into the Unyanyembe Journal, the 1870 Field Diary occupies the unusual position of being first- and second-stage at once. Here Livingstone wrote several entries, spread over many months, on his experiences with an animal he calls a “soko,” a type of monkey.</p>

<p>Initially, Livingstone reports in August 1870 that the soko “takes away my appetite by his disgusting bestiality of appearance” (1870c:IV). By 1 March 1871, he has taken a female soko as a pet, and writes the she “holds out her hand for people to lift her up” and “comes and sits down on my mat beside me as a child would do” (1871e:XC). These accounts, which Livingstone never revised, were partially grouped together by Waller under a single section in the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874,2:52-55) and resulted in a posthumous contribution to African natural history in the <em>Zoologist</em> in 1875.</p>

<p>Certain accounts in the 1870 Field Diary, though, never went beyond its pages, as they were excised from the published version. Waller relied almost exclusively on the 1870 Field Diary when creating the published version, so the text that has been edited out is recorded nowhere else.</p>

<p>For instance, Livingstone complains at length with what he calls the “Nassick boys” or “Nassickers,” graduates of the government-run Nassick School for freed slaves in India. Livingstone states that the Nassick porters belong to “the lowest or criminal class in Africa” (1870b:[54]) and ascribes their poor behavior, including threats of mutiny, to the lax treatment at the Nassick school in India: “These might either work play or do nothing at Nassick &amp; not one of them could handle a tool” (1870b:[53]). The problem, Livingstone concludes, is that “the teacher feared that if punished for idleness they would run away and bring discredit on the Asylum” (1870b:[54]).</p>

<p>If, as Helly has described, Waller’s goal was to “preserve and protect Livingstone’s fame as the missionary explorer par excellence in order to use that fame as the basis for an antislavery crusade in East Africa,” it is perhaps no wonder that Waller omitted Livingstone’s opinion of both the institution of Nassick and its graduates (Helly 1987:163). But Livingstone evinced no such concerns by revising or omitting these complaints himself.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Livingstone’s men later mutiny, he writes in the 1870 Field Diary that, in order to restore order, “I had to treat them as slaves and promised on the word of an Englishman that I would shoot the ringleader against my orders” (1871b:LXXXV). This incendiary phrase is reduced by Waller in the <em>Last Journals</em> to a passive reference to using “fear of pistol shot” (1874,2:99). The <em>Last Journals</em> then completely removes from the 1870 Field Diary entry noting Livingstone’s conclusion that if his porters did not obey, “I would certainly shoot them” (1871b:LXXXVI). Though Waller may have seen these sentiments as politically liable, Livingstone had no compunction about recording such opinions and threats, suggesting that the 1870 Field Diary functions much more like Bridges’ “‘raw’” record than a second-stage document.</p>

<p>In addition, our critical edition provides access to the original version of a “Retrospect” from March 1870 that Livingstone recopied in the Unyanyembe Journal (1870a). This free-floating piece predates the 1870 Field Diary, but works like it in that Livingstone intended it “to be inserted in the Journal if I get back to where it is left in Ujiji” (1870a:[1]). Livingstone opens the piece by musing on his missionary career. He concludes that, though he had been criticized for his failures to convert local African populations, he has no regrets except for the treatment of his family: “Though conscious of many imperfections not a single pang of regret arises in the review of my conduct except that I did not feel it to be my duty while spending all my energy in teaching the heathen, to devote a special portion of my time to play with my children” (1870a:[1]).</p>

<p>This highly personal meditation responds to public critique that Livingstone sacrificed his family for personal gain. That Livingstone recorded it in early 1870 and then expressly recopied it in the Unyanyembe Journal at a later date suggests that the two texts serve different functions for Livingstone.</p>

<p>Ultimately, by reading Field Diary XIII, the 1870 Field Diary, and the Unyanyembe Journal as overlapping documents, we can see how Livingstone used the materials available to him to create a record without the sequentially staged documents he employed at other points in his career. For this time period, Livingstone is not composing in stages but venturing on a new composition practice out of necessity.</p>

<p>Creating the 1870 Field Diary as he goes, using Field Diary XIII in a very limited way, and with thoughts of developing future records in the Unyanyembe Journal if he makes it back to the Ujiji, the conditions of Livingstone’s exploration shape his composition practices. The existence of these varying manuscripts act as their own record of Livingstone’s experiences, as much as what he wrote down. That these documents do not always conform to the typical three-stage model suggests that we must mine all levels of textual production to understand how material conditions affected the imperial record, rendering it heterogenous, partial, and often incomplete.</p>

<p>David Livingstone wrote the 1871 Field Diary during his final African expedition (1866-73). Sir Roderick Murchison, President of the Royal Geographical Society, set Livingstone’s primary objective for this expedition as determining the water system of Central Africa by exploring the region between Lakes Nyassa and Tanganyika. Murchison hoped that by this expedition Livingstone would "be paving the way for the introduction of social improvements among the natives, by the promotion of fair barter and commerce, to the exclusion of the trade in slaves" and that Livingstone would "act as a pioneer in removing those obstacles" that prevented Christian missionaries from traveling to these regions (Murchison 1864-65:264).</p>

<p>With these statements, Murchison reiterated Livingstone’s own vision for linking exploration with Christianity, commerce, and civilization in the service of ending the slave trade in Africa. Though Livingstone’s final journey pre-dated the European scramble for Africa of the 1880s, Murchison’s words gave evidence of the mounting desire for British influence on the continent. Framed as improving life for Africans, Livingstone’s mission – if successful – would increase British production and trade and increase the widening sphere of British control.</p>

<p>Livingstone had unveiled this vision in his best-selling <em>Missionary Travels and Researches</em> (1857), a book that made him a household name by detailing his four-year coast-to-coast journey across Africa. Livingstone’s first attempt to realize the vision, the ill-fated Zambesi Expedition (1858-64), ended in failure and recall, due to problems caused by natural obstacles and personal conflicts among expedition members. The 1866 expedition offered Livingstone a chance to redeem his reputation by paving the way for a potential new era of British colonial endeavor in Africa.</p>

<p>The expedition would also tackle – Murchison hinted – the thorny and highly controversial issue of the Nile River’s ultimate source (Murchison 1864-65:264-65; for more on the objectives of Livingstone\'s final expedition, see Bridges 1973). In the 1860s, the location of this source divided British geographers and explorers. Some believed that the Nile originated (as it does) in Lake Victoria, which the explorer John Hanning Speke had first sighted in 1858. Others argued that a river flowing out of the northern end of Lake Tanganyika gave rise to the Nile (this river, the Rusizi, in fact flows into the lake and has no connection to the Nile). But no one knew for certain. "Nothing short of actual exploration can determine these questions," stated Murchison (1864-65:265).</p>

<p>Livingstone’s final expedition took him over a wide stretch of East and Central Africa, through the areas that today constitute Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Livingstone – as he travelled and as he questioned other travellers – developed an elaborate theory of the Central African river system. He "came to the conclusion that there were three main interconnecting \'lines of drainage\' in central Africa," all running north to south in parallel (Jeal 1973:323). All three lines, according to Livingstone, fed the Nile.</p>

<p class="space1" style="line-height:110%"><a href="/sites/default/files/spectral-imaging/livingstone-in-1871/liv_016027_0001.jpg"><img alt="The Central African watershed as it is (left) and as Livingstone believed it to be (right).

<p>In Livingstone\'s theory, the eastern line (which ran through Lakes Tanganyika and Albert) and the central line (the Congo’s Lualaba River) both took rise – at least partly – in Lakes Moero and Bangweulu farther to the south. The central line and western line (the Congo’s Lomami River), however, originated in a more exotic source. In one of his letters, Livingstone described it as "a remarkable mound" that "gives out four fountains not more than 10 miles apart," with the two fountains to the south giving rise to "the Liamba or Upper Zambesi" and "the Kafui" rivers. These four fountains, Livingstone concluded, were "probably the Nile fountains, which were described to Herodotus as unfathomable, and sending one-half of the water to Egypt, the other half to inner Ethiopia" (Livingstone 1879:480; cf. Herodotus 1987:141-45).</p>

<p>During the final years of his life, Livingstone became obsessed with reaching this mound and proving his theory of the river system. In 1869, Livingstone’s explorations took him from Ujiji, an Arab trading depot on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, to the Manyema region west of the lake, which Zanzibari Arab traders had just begun to pioneer in their search for ivory. Livingstone intended to pass through Manyema rapidly, then strike the Lualaba River, which lay some 240 miles west of Ujiji (Livingstone estimated the distance at 300 miles), with the goal of exploring the river and resolving its mysteries. Did it feed the Nile (as Livingstone hoped) or was it part of the Congo River system (as Livingstone feared)?</p>

<p>The journey to the Lualaba, however, took much longer than anticipated. Livingstone departed from Ujiji on 12 July 1869. He did not reach Nyangwe, a small village on the right bank of the Lualaba, until nearly two years later, 30 March 1871. The delay in travel had partly to do with the "large belts of primeval forest" that lay between Tanganyika and the Lualaba, and partly because "irritable ulcers on the feet" and other issues had stopped Livingstone in the Congolese village of Bambarre for nearly seven months from 22 July 1870 to 16 February 1871 (Livingstone 1872a:2; 1870e:X).</p>

<p>Due to these delays, Livingstone – now some 880 miles from the east coast of Africa – had run low on many essential supplies, including writing paper and iron gall ink. He did have a single eight-page copy of <em>The Standard</em> newspaper dated 24 November 1869, which he had received on 4 February 1871 along with letters and other materials from Horace Waller, his friend and future editor (see the section on <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript-1871-field-diary">The Manuscript of the 1871 Field Diary</a>). Livingstone cut up the sheets of this newspaper and assembled two thirty-two page "copy-books" (Waller, in Livingstone 1874,2:114n.). Livingstone wrote his first entry in the first of these copy-books – now collectively known as the 1871 Field Diary – on 23 March 1871, just a few days before he reached the village of Nyangwe.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century witnessed the consolidation of an Arab-African trading network across East Africa, and the gradual expansion of this network into the Congo in the search of new ivory fields. "[…]There were not only places where goods were stored and people gathered, such as ports and a few large markets," writes Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch (2005:210), "but many smaller centers that we still know little about. The smaller centers may have moved from place to place and served as caravan stops, portage resting points, military posts, and slave markets on a more or less temporary basis. Together they made up a complete, structured trade network." Nyangwe played a key role in this network.</p>

<p>In 1871 Nyangwe had only been an Arab trading depot for about ten years, but it was the westernmost Arab settlement in Central Africa and, along with Ujiji and Tabora, one of the three main Arab centers on the trading routes that ran from the east coast of Africa into the interior. Although environmental conditions made travel to Nyangwe difficult, the fragmentation of the local populations facilitated the arrival of heavily-armed Arab caravans (Ceulemans 1959:43). In settling at Nyangwe, Arab traders and their African forces first depopulated the neighboring villages (Stanley 1876-77:25 Oct. 1876), then attacked and displaced Nyangwe’s original inhabitants, the Wagenya (or, as Livingstone calls them, the Bagenya) to the opposite bank of the Lualaba River (Cameron 1874:4 Aug. 1874). Finally, the Arabs maintained control over the settlement through the use of intimidation and violence.</p>

<p>Because of such violence, the Wagenya grew to distrust all new visitors to the region: "One hoary-headed old fellow said that no good to the Wagenya had ever resulted from the advent of strangers," wrote the explorer Verney Lovett Cameron, who visited Nyangwe a few years after Livingstone, "and he should advise each and all of his countrymen to refuse to sell or hire a single canoe to the white man" (1877a,2:6). Livingstone soon discovered that he would not be an exception to this distrust.</p>

<p>For the Arabs, however, securing the cooperation of the local population served only to facilitate a larger goal: exploring the lands west and north of Nyangwe in order to find new sources of ivory and other trade goods. Nyangwe’s central location made it an ideal base and launching point, and, eventually, the settlement helped define a larger zone of Arab activity, influence, and, most importantly, slave trading (Stanley 1970:321). A succession of well-known Arab traders became associated with the settlement, including its founder Mwini Dugumbi and the notorious Tagamoio (a.k.a Mtagamoyo or Mwini Mohara), the ringleader of the Nyangwe massacre (Anon 1892, 1894). Nyangwe itself grew from a "mere Arab depot," as Stanley described it (1877-78:154), into one of the major Arab trading centers west of Lake Tanganyika by the late 1880s with a population approaching 10,000 residents (Renault 1989:148).</p>

<p>Its significance to Arab traders notwithstanding, Nyangwe also served as the site of an important African periodic barter market. This market functioned as a key point of contact between the fishing populations of the river and the agricultural communities based in the area around Nyangwe. Livingstone (1872d:13) noted that "The market was attended every fourth day by between 2,000 and 3,000 people." Thanks to such numbers, the market facilitated trade in a wide range of items, including slaves. During one visit to the market, Livingstone (1871f:CXV) had the opportunity to question slaves taken from at least nine different regions beyond Nyangwe. Because of Nyangwe’s location, the market also provided a crucial link between the great Luba Empire centered in the savannah lands to the south and the Lega people scattered through the rainforest to the north (Biebuyck 1973; Reefe 1981).</p>

<p>Nyangwe’s cultural and economic role alongside the rise of Arab trading in the region, therefore, ensured that the settlement facilitated interaction among a variety of groups: the Arabs and their forces; slaves transported to Nyangwe by the Arabs; the Luba and Lega communities; the diverse ethnic communities residing in the vicinity of Nyangwe; and, finally, the Wagenya fishermen, who were linked to these others groups through control of traffic on the Lualaba River. The items available for trade in Nyangwe reflected the diversity of the populations that frequented the market, and included local products such as fish – fifteen different types by Livingstone’s count (1872d:13), products transported across longer distances, and items introduced by the Arabs.</p>

<p>Livingstone stayed in Nyangwe from 30 March to 20 July 1871. Much of the time he remained free from fever and ever-ready to depart. He interviewed Arab travellers, their slaves, and local African inhabitants about local geographical details, and he considered possible travel routes. He also attended the market regularly (28 were held during his time in Nyangwe) and took great delight in watching the market sellers at their work: "[May] 12th a set in rain from Nor West did not deter the market today – people came singing and sheltered with mats" (1871f:CXXXVII).</p>

<p>Such moments offered a relief to his ongoing troubles in Nyangwe with the "Banian slaves," a group of liberated slaves sent to Livingstone by John Kirk, the British Consul at Zanzibar. These slaves continuously aggravated Livingstone, launched forays against local inhabitants, refused to go forward in travel, and, finally, conspired to turn the inhabitants of Nyangwe against Livingstone. The behavior of these men shook Livingstone’s faith in the ability of slaves to be rehabilitated and drew a volley of invectives. Waller later cut the most vituperative of these while editing Livingstone\'s Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), in particular because the comments also referenced Livingstone’s grievances against John Kirk (Helly 1987:179-81).</p>

<p>During these early months in Nyangwe, Livingstone also made a sustained attempt to purchase a canoe from the Wagenya fishermen of the Lualaba River. An adequate canoe was crucial for further exploration of the river. Yet the enterprise proved quite frustrating. Its unexpected culmination became one of the key incidents that Livingstone compressed and rewrote when he revised the 1871 Field Diary to produce the corresponding entries in the Unyanyembe Journal.</p>

<p>In April, the 1871 Field Diary indicates, Livingstone repeatedly failed to secure a canoe or even gain the trust of the local population through his own efforts. In May, he turned to the Arab trader Abed for help, and the two of them tried to negotiate for a canoe with an African chief named Kalenga. The venture not only failed, but also resulted in Livingstone being cheated of a "thousand cowries – three goats beads" when Kalenga revealed that the canoe belonged to someone else and was not his to sell in the first place (1871f:CXXXV).</p>

<p>In response, Livingstone attempted to restrain his anger, especially as he knew that the Arabs were watching his every move: "It is very grievous to be cheated after losing nearly three months in the business but Kalenga has no canoe and I must not be the first to do what may be called injustice [ – ] The Arabs would like to see me using force" (1871f:CXXXV).</p>

<p>Yet Livingstone could not put the matter to rest. "The conduct of Kalenga to me is not be endured," he notes in the entry of 12 June. "It is the most childish impertinence because he thinks nothing will be done to him but talk as Manyema do &amp; have done for ages” (1871f:CXXXVII). The next entry follows these developments to their conclusion:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">13th chitoka = men off to force Kalenga to reason = if he refuses to refund to bind and give him a flogging – if It [sic] is entirely lost then return and get of my beads to buy another canoe down the river – Kalenga fled – (1871f:CXXXVII)</p>

<p>It is an astonishing turn of events, a moment that shows Livingstone attempting to harness the violent tendencies of the Banian slaves – tendencies that he otherwise deplores – against a member of the local African population.</p>

<p>In the Unyanyembe Journal, Livingstone removed the Banian slaves from the narrative of this incident and reduced the whole series of interactions with Kalenga to a few sentences in the 20 May 1871 entry:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">Abed called Kalenga the headman who beguiled him as I soon found and delivered the canoe he had bought formally to me and went off down the Lualaba on foot to buy the Babira ivory – I was to follow in the canoe and wait for him in the River Luira but soon I ascertained that the canoe was still in the forest and did not belong to Kalenga – On demanding back the price he said let Abed come and I will give it to him – Then when I sent to force him to give up the goods all his village fled into the forest (1866-72:[680])</p>

<p>The language is restrained. This version lacks the immediacy of the 1871 Field Diary, and Livingstone’s revisions effectively neutralize the final turn of events. Livingstone forestalls any connection a reader might make between the general contours of this incident and the event that would soon become the defining moment of Livingstone’s time in Nyangwe.</p>

<p>On 15 July 1871, the whole tenor of Livingstone’s experiences in Nyangwe changed dramatically. It was a market day, and Livingstone attended as always. He was just leaving when a few Arab traders (the number varies by account) entered the market carrying guns. A moment later, possibly after an argument with the sellers, the Arabs began to fire on the market goers, most of whom were women.</p>

<p>The local inhabitants held the market on a stretch of open land on the right bank of the Lualaba River, near a creek that flowed into the river. This creek offered a convenient place to land canoes. When the firing began, a general panic ensued. Everyone ran for the canoes, but a second group of Arabs near the creek also began to fire on the crowd. Now everyone made for the Lualaba – even those who could not swim – and threw themselves in. The Arabs continued to fire. In the ensuing chaos, many of those who avoided the gunfire got caught in the current and drowned.</p>

<p>All told some 400 or 500 individuals died, with others being captured by the Arabs to be made slaves. In addition, the Arabs crossed the river and began attacking and setting fire to many of the villages on the left bank. Livingstone counted 17 villages in flames. The "slaughter" (1866-72:[692]) continued into the next day.</p>

<p>The reasons for the attack, which came into focus only gradually, are as follows. A few days earlier Manilla, one of the head African slaves of the Arabs, went over to the left bank and sacked 10 villages of the Mohombo tribe on behalf of a Wagenya chief named Kimburu (Livingstone 1871f:CXLI). The Arabs under Dugumbe resented Manilla’s forward behaviour and attacked the market goers and Kimburu’s people in retaliation.</p>

<p>Nearly 70 years ago, Sir Reginald Coupland (1945:77ff.) definitively outlined the factors that prevented Livingstone from continuing his explorations forward from Nyangwe and, therefore, that led to the Livingstone-Stanley meeting. These included illness, resistance from the Banian slaves, and a variety of local factors. However, no single event impacted Livingstone’s plans as profoundly and rapidly as the massacre. In the July 16 entry of the 1871 Field Diary, Livingstone writes that "the murderous assault on the market people was Hell without the fire and brimstone […] It filled me with unspeakable horror" (1871f:CLI). By July 17 he had made his decision to return to Ujiji. On 20 July he departed.</p>

<p>The chief perpetrator of the massacre was one Tagamoio, whom Livingstone did not mention in the 1871 Field Diary until this moment (Tagamoio does appear on the last page of the <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1870-field-diary">1870 Field Diary</a>; see 1871e:CI). He would become notorious through the published accounts of the massacre, but he escaped punishment. In fact, over the ensuing two decades Tagamoio established himself as one of the leading Arabs at Nyangwe and remained so until brought down by the forces of the Congo Free State in 1893 (Hinde 1895, 1897).</p>

<p>For the last 140 years, scholars and the public have relied on several accounts for the story of the Nyangwe massacre. These include one in a 14 November 1871 letter to Earl Granville (Livingstone 1872d), that of the Unyanyembe Journal (Livingstone 1866-72:[691]-[696]), another in the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874:132-36) and several produced by Stanley based on Livingstone’s description (Stanley 1970; 1877-78; 1878). Conversely, the account in the 1871 Field Diary (1871f:CXLVI-CXLVIII), which diverges significantly from these other narratives, has not been available until now.</p>

<p>The three accounts produced by Livingstone himself (1866-72, 1871f, 1872d) will be the subject of discussion here. Although Helly (1987) has written brilliantly of the editorial changes that Horace Waller made to the Unyanyembe Journal to produce the <em>Last Journals</em>, her observations do not cover the case of the Nyangwe massacre. Only minor editorial changes, such as capitalization and punctuation, distinguish the Unyanyembe Journal and <em>Last Journals</em> narratives of the massacre. The narrative shape of the 1871 letter, written a few months after the massacre, also bears a strong affinity to the Unyanyembe Journal and <em>Last Journals</em> texts.</p>

<p>In the case of the 1871 letter and Unyanyembe Journal, Livingstone writes with the full benefit of hindsight. The opportunity to reflect allows him to organize his narrative and to present the massacre as a fully coherent set of events. As a result, the 1871 letter and Unyanyembe Journal narratives are reflective and written primarily in the past tense. Livingstone details the motives of the principal actors, with Tagamoio’s activities throughout the massacre receiving extended attention. He also elaborates wherever necessary in order to give a full picture of events and their underlying causes: "The wish to make an impression in the country as to the importance and the greatness of the new comers was the most potent motive" (1866-72:[695]).</p>

<p>Most importantly, from the start Livingstone carefully represents his own reactions, and his efforts on behalf of the local population. For instance, he offers an account for his own lack of intervention: "My first impulse was to pistol the murderers but Dugumbe protested against my getting into a blood feud and I was thankful afterwards that I took his advice" (1866-72:[694]). Livingstone also notes how he directed his followers to rescue one group of Africans: "I sent men with our flag to save some for without a flag they might have been victims" (1866-72:[695]). Livingstone’s Arab associate Dugumbe likewise appears in a favorable light. Dugumbe shows remorse for the massacre (1866-72:[698]) and attempts to rescue a number of Africans: "Dugumbe put people into one of the deserted vessels to save those in the water – and saved twenty-one" (1866-72:[693]).</p>

The left-hand page continues a later part of the narrative.</span></p>

<p>The 1871 Field Diary presents the massacre in a radically different manner. The massacre has only begun when Livingstone starts writing, and it continues to unfold as Livingstone composes. This singular circumstance has a wide range of implications. Livingstone takes his readers into the midst of the massacre with prose that is remarkably compressed, vivid, and immediate:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">15th July 1871 The reports of guns on the other side of Lualaba tell of Dugumbe\'s men murdering Kimburu and another for slaves = Manilla is in it again = and it is said that Kimburu gave him 3 slaves to sack the ten villages we saw in flames – He is meeting his doom in spite of mixing blood and giving nine slaves for the operation = Moenemgunga was his victim = &amp; so it goes on making me fear to go with Dugumbe\'s people to be partakers in their blood guiltiness (1871f:CXLVI).</p>

<p>This is a private document, legible to the writer, but not necessarily to others. Livingstone shows much but tells little. He introduces individuals without gloss and tersely goes from cause to effect. Manilla, it appears, is not only leading the foray, but in doing so has broken his pact of friendship with Kimburu.</p>

<p>The Unyanyembe Journal offers a strikingly different account of these opening moments:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">15th July 1871 The reports of guns on the other side of the Lualaba all the morning tell of the people of Dugumbe murdering those of Kimburu and others who mixed blood with Manilla – Manilla is a slave and how dared he to mix blood with chiefs who could only have made friends with free men like them – Kimburu gave Manilla three slaves and he sacked ten villages in token of friendship – He proposed to give Dugumbe nine slaves in the same operation But Dugumbe\'s people destroy his villages and shoot and make his people captives to punish Manilla - make an impression in fact in the country that they alone are to be dealt with - Make friends with us and not with Manilla or any one else (1866-72:[691]-[692]).</p>

<p>Livingstone is not just editing; he is reconfiguring his representation of reality, and has begun to write with an audience in mind. He elaborates and explains wherever necessary and ends by providing direct access to the minds and the motives of the principal perpetrators. We discover that Dugumbe’s people – but not Manilla – bear the responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>In fact, a comparative look at the descriptions of the massacre in the 1871 Field Diary and Unyanyembe Journal reveals that Livingstone has carried out major revisions in producing the latter. For example, Livingstone has made the entries for 15 and 16 July in the Unyanyembe Journal nearly twice as long as those of the 1871 Field Diary. In many instances he has significantly reconfigured the order of the extracts taken from the 1871 Field Diary. He has added a series of descriptive passages to the narrative of the Unyanyembe Journal. In addition, ink analysis of the relevant 1871 Field Diary pages reveals a poignant detail of composition otherwise lost in Livingstone’s Unyanyembe Journal transcription: namely, that in recording the massacre, Livingstone switched to his remaining reserve of iron gall ink in an attempt to ensure the permanence of his words (see <a href="/spectral-imaging/livingstone’s-composition-methods">Livingstone\'s Composition Methods</a>).</p>

<p>More importantly, the narrative of the 1871 Field Diary unfolds with all the uncertainty of lived experience, especially under such circumstances as a massacre. Livingstone expends much energy in trying to understand developing events, identifying the culprits, and figuring out their motives. The prose does not immediately clarify the relationship between the Nyangwe massacre and the village attacks on the west bank. Moreover, Livingstone fails to exculpate Dugumbe and doesn\'t discover the leading role of Tagamoio until well into the 16 July entry (1871f:CXLIX). In fact, that 16 July moment represents the first time Livingstone even names Tagamoio. By contrast, in the Unyanyembe Journal version Tagamoio receives extended attention from the middle of the 15 July entry onward.</p>

<p>As a result, the 1871 Field Diary offers a fascinating glimpse into Livingstone’s mind at the moment of the greatest crisis in his final travels. Despite his familiarity with slavery in Africa, the scale of the Nyangwe massacre exceeds his range of experience, and he struggles to come to terms with the event. Resistance by the Arab traders to clarify the underlying motives for the massacre, the chaotic order of Livingstone’s successive 15 July diary entries, and his unprecedented shift to hourly entries on 16 July all underscore his deep vulnerability and confusion at the moment of the massacre.</p>

<p>Still other moments reveal Livingstone’s conflicted thoughts regarding an appropriate response to the violence and his potential culpability for at least some of it. For instance, Livingstone assists whatever African villagers come to him for help, as both the 1871 Field Diary and Unyanyembe Journal make clear. In anger, he also considers an extreme, out of character response: "I went over to Dugumbe and proposed to catch the bloodhounds who fired in the chitoka and on the canoes and put their heads on poles" (1871f:CXLVIII; see above for the edited Unyanyembe Journal version).</p>

In transcribing the 1871 Field Diary into the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72), Livingstone considerably changed the representation of such raw emotion.</span></p>

<p>Yet Livingstone also makes decisions of questionable merit, as when he sends his men with a flag to assist Manilla’s brother (1871f:CXLVII), not local villagers as the Unyanyembe Journal version would have it. More significantly, the structuring of events in the 1871 Field Diary foregrounds the possible role of Livingstone’s Banian slaves in the massacre.</p>

<p>As noted above, Livingstone had previously instructed the Banian slaves to bind and flog the headman Kalenga when the latter "bamboozled" Livingstone out of the payment for a canoe (1871f:CXXXIV). Yet Livingstone compressed this incident and moved it away temporally from the Nyangwe massacre when producing the Unyanyembe Journal. It is not clear why Livingstone made this revision, although he may have feared that readers of his Journal might believe that his violence towards Kalenga offered some sort of model for the Arabs. Livingstone notes as much in the 1871 Field Diary: "I must not be the first to do what may be called injustice [ – ] The Arabs would like to see me using force" (1871f:CXXXV).</p>

<p>In writing up the Unyanyembe Journal, Livingstone also made other changes to his representations of the Banian slaves. For instance, he deliberately revised one particularly damning passage from 30 April 1871. In the 1871 Field Diary, Livingstone records a report of some Arab traders a few days distant being in need of assistance. Although called on to send help to them, Livingstone writes, "I refused to send my slaves because they would only add to the confusion and murder – If they go anywhere I must go with them or murder is certain" (1871f:CXXIII).</p>

The revised version of the segment in the Unyanyembe Journal (1866-72) diminishes Livingstone\'s original sentiments and places them at a greater temporal remove by assigning this text to an earlier date.</span></p>

<p>In the Unyanyembe Journal, he incorporates this comment into an earlier entry, 25 April, and rewords it as follows: “I declined – because no matter what charges I gave my Banian slaves would be sure to shed human blood” (1866-72:[671]). Most obviously, such revisions help diminish the original sentiments, and there is the temporal distancing once more. Livingstone’s motives for these revisions again remain unknown. Certainly the original passage is at odds with his usual complaints about the resistance of the slaves to further exploration and their attempts to slander him before the inhabitants of Nyangwe – relatively mild complaints when compared to the unrevised passage. Or, put another way, Livingstone’s overall presentation of the Banian slaves becomes more benign – however contemptuous it might still seem – when the passage regarding their murderous tendencies is reworded.</p>

<p>In the Unyanyembe Journal, the consistency of such "benign" representations serves at least one significant narrative purpose. It gives Livingstone grounds to refute the accusation leveled by Arab slave traders that the Banian slaves had a role in carrying out the Nyangwe massacre:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">Two wretched Moslems asserted "that the firing was done by the people of the English" I asked one of them why he lied so and he could utter no excuse – no other falsehood came to his aid as he stood abashed before me and telling him not to tell palpable falsehoods left him gaping (1866-72:[694]).</p>

<p>In the 1871 Field Diary, the representation of this moment and Livingstone’s response is much more ambiguous:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">shot after shot followed on the terrified fugitives = great numbers died – and a worthless Moslem asserted that all was done by the people of the English – This will spread though the murderers are on the other side plundering and shooting – It is awful – terrible (1871f:CXLVI)</p>

<p>Although Livingstone’s prose may imply a refutation, explicitly he fails to foreclose the possibility that his slaves took part in the Nyangwe massacre. Moreover, the difference between the two versions again helps to foreground a larger pattern of apparent revision.</p>

<p>Dorothy Helly has written eloquently of the public impact of Livingstone’s description of the Nyangwe massacre in the 1871 letter version:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">Livingstone’s vivid characterization of the wholesale bloodshed that could disrupt daily life in Africa as a consequence of the slave trade came at a crucial moment. His words fed into a well-planned campaign recently launched within antislavery circles to stir up public clamor for ending the seaborne slave trade that supplied the Middle East and the island of Zanzibar and its sources on the adjacent East Coast of Africa (Helly 1987:26).</p>

<p>British abolitionists achieved this objective just one year after the publication of Livingstone’s letter, with the signing in June 1873 of the treaty between Britain and the Sultan of Zanzibar for the suppression of the slave trade. Livingstone and his cause "would thereafter remain synonymous, just as Wilberforce’s name had come to symbolize the antislavery cause on the Atlantic coast of Africa earlier in the century" (Helly 1987:27).</p>

<p>The 1871 Field Diary – only now made available through spectral imaging and processing – opens a new dimension in our understanding of these historical developments. It is not unreasonable to suppose, given the revisions cited above, that Livingstone’s slaves had a part in inciting the Nyangwe massacre or, at least, that Livingstone feared that their actions and his own had helped launch the chain of violent events that led to the massacre. As a result, he sought to downplay these points when revising the 1871 Field Diary to produce the Unyanyembe Journal.</p>

<p>Of course, we cannot confirm this hypothesis without the discovery of more evidence. However, if true, it would mean that by bringing these Banian slaves to Nyangwe, Livingstone – however inadvertently – helped occasion the horrific event that transformed the trajectory of his final travels in Africa and that established the image of the tireless abolitionist crusader that we remember today.</p>

<p>The materials published through this critical edition of Livingstone’s final manuscripts (1865-1873) open a new phase in the study of nineteenth-century European exploration of Africa. Manuscripts resulting from David Livingstone’s final journey to Africa survive in abundance but have been difficult to access for almost a century and a half. This edition, for the first time, makes publicly available the full collection of final manuscripts held by the David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre, Scotland.</p>

<p>This is the largest single-archive collection of its kind. Our edition comprises over 2,700 images of original manuscript pages from Livingstone’s last expedition to Africa, with <a href="/islandora/search/NOT letter NOT spectral NOT shire NOT rumor NOT blotting NOT signatures?access=both_transcription&amp;f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A[1866+TO+1873]" target="_blank">over 2,200 of those pages</a> encoded, edited, and framed with modern critical essays. The manuscripts decisively dismantle the Victorian notion of the iconic explorer detached from history and instead take readers into a complex continent, teeming with diverse cultures, ideas, and networks of exchange.</p>

<p>Unlike his first two journeys, Livingstone embarked on his third and final journey to Africa with no clear affiliations. Though he had the title “Roving Consul,” he was not paid by the British government for his work in examining the watershed of Central Africa. And although he still considered himself a missionary at heart, he was not officially carrying out missionary work. Because of these ambiguities, the manuscripts in which Livingstone recorded his final travels (journals, diaries, notebooks, maps, and more) include a breadth of rhetorical strategies, as well as a wide array of information.</p>

<p>The manuscripts describe the cultures of diverse African ethnic groups, their technologies, and architectural practices; record zoological, botanical, and geological information; explore the vicissitudes of east African caravan culture and the Arab-led east and central African slave trades; and catalogue geographical, magnetic, and astronomical data. The manuscripts also include a wide range of illustrations and maps and, in addition, bear material witness to nineteenth-century Africa in the form of insects and plants pressed between manuscript pages as well as the many ways that diverse African environments have left stains and other marks on individual pages.</p>

Livingstone\'s maps, such as this one, can contain a complex array of textual data. The stain at the center of the image may also hold clues about the environments in which Livingstone created and/or transported the map.</span></p>

<p>The manuscripts are also notable for their geographical breadth and as records of cross-cultural social interaction. During the seven years of this final journey, Livingstone passed through vast regions of east and central Africa, which would today include Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was accompanied by porters he recruited en route plus those from farther afield: freed African slaves educated at a school in Nashik, India; men from the island of Anjouan, Comoros; and a contingent of Sepoys (Indian soldiers). In addition, he received aid from the very Arabs whose slave trade he despised. And while for years Livingstone traveled without contact with Europeans, this is also the journey in which Livingstone experienced his highly-publicized meeting with Henry M. Stanley in 1871.</p>

<p>Our critically mediated digital edition of these final manuscripts – only a small percentage of which had been edited to modern standards and published prior to this edition – will enhance critical analysis of nineteenth-century African and British imperial history as well as the production of nineteenth-century scientific knowledge. After Livingstone’s death in Africa in 1873, Horace Waller edited, radically revised, and published Livingstone’s manuscripts as the <em>Last Journals</em> (1874), a work that has been the primary source for this period of Livingstone’s life and his travels for the last 140 years.</p>

For another such image, see our page on the <a href="/his-own-words/scope-edition">Scope of the Edition</a>.</span></p>

<p>Through the present edition, we publish in full a majority of the manuscripts upon which Waller based his edition. Moreover, our edition offers <a href="/his-own-words/multiple-versions-text">multiple versions of Livingstone’s texts</a> – field diaries and rough notebooks, polished journals and maps, and a digital facsimile of Waller’s edition – in short, a collection of primary materials that allows users to study the creation, editing, and publication of Livingstone’s texts end to end. To orient readers and provide a critical framework, the edition also includes a rich array of <a href="http://livingstoneonline.org/his-own-words/edition-guide#link3">paratextual materials</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this edition, our focus has been on foregrounding the many contexts of Livingstone’s travels: seeking out his information sources, his living conditions, his traveling partners, and his interlocutors. By publishing these difficult-to-access manuscripts, we hope to encourage vibrant scholarly debate. Our digital edition of the manuscripts from this period promises to transform our understanding of Livingstone’s last journey and will illuminate not only the many facets of nineteenth-century African life that Livingstone recorded, but also broader nineteenth-century Anglophone strategies for representing foreign peoples, cultures, and technologies.</p>

<p>Field Diary XVII – just 32 pages long – chronicles the eighteen days leading up to Livingstone’s death. In the opening pages he writes that he is “pale bloodless and weak from bleeding profusely ever since the 31st March,” but notes that he still wishes to continue: “Oh how I long to be permitted by the Overpower to finish my work” (Livingstone 1873b:[15]). He continues to hope for a recovery, believing that his illness may be fever and dosing himself with quinine.</p>

<p>Yet continued bleeding leaves him extremely weak, first able to walk for only an hour or two and finally unable to move at all, even when carried. Written in shaky handwriting, his last entry remains hopeful: “knocked up quite and remain = recover sent to buy milch goats - We are on the banks of R[iver] Molilamo” (Livingstone 1873b:[31]).</p>

<p>These last entries show that the problems Livingstone recorded in Field Diary XVI persist: geographical confusion and difficult interactions with the local populations. Livingstone continues around Lake Bangweolo, but due to bad measurements, he is mistaken about the lake’s position, an error compounded by the lake’s marshy edge: “it is quite impossible at present to tell where land ends &amp; Lake begins” (Livingstone 1873b:[6]).</p>

<p>Livingstone also encounters continued resistance from the locals, who believe he stole the canoes he is using, though he insists that he paid for them. Local fisherman refuse to give directions, and he records “fear in all the inhabitants” that makes it difficult to interact (Livingstone 1873b:[8]).</p>

<p>Till the end of his life, Livingstone continues to make detailed scientific measurements and records observations on botany, ecology, and local culture. The few pages of this diary include descriptions of subaqueous plants, fish anatomy, and local methods for catching fish.</p>

<p>Field Diary XVII is the same kind of book Livingstone used for Field Diaries <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-xv-overview">XV</a> and <a href="/his-own-words/field-diary-xvi-overview">XVI</a>: black, with a flip top, and a metal clasp at the bottom. It measures 159 mm high by 92 mm wide by 16 mm thick, and the Stirling University conservation note records that it contained a “pencil so short Livingstone had to cobble something together to help him grasp it” (Livingstone 1873b:[36]).</p>

<p><br />
The page immediately following Livingstone’s final entry records a note by Jacob Wainwright, one of Livingstone’s long-time porters. It records the date and time on which Livingstone presumably passed away and outlines the contents of Livingstone’s box. Given Livingstone’s dependence on his porters, as well as his sometimes-troubled relationship with them, it seems fitting that, in the last field diary, Wainwright inscribes the final entry.</p>

<p>The pages of the 1871 Field Diary conform to a series of basic patterns. Collectively, these patterns reveal the development of Livingstone\'s narrative objectives as he writes the diary. This section sets out an analysis of the structure of the 1871 Field Diary, including Livingstone’s numbering system, the distinction between journal entries and notes, Livingstone’s orthography, and a handful of additional elements (sketches, maps, calculations, extraneous foreign text, and flourishes to correct ink flow).</p>

<p>Livingstone numbers the 64 pages of the Nyangwe segment (1871f) of the 1871 Field Diary with Roman numerals from CII to CLXIII. The sequence of numbers in this stretch is continuous except for a few mistakes and anomalies, as follows:</p>

<p><strong>CXXXII</strong> – Livingstone repeats this number (1871f:CXXXII [v.1] and 1871f:CXXXII [v.2]).<br />
<strong>CXXXIII</strong> – Livingstone repeats this number (1871f:CXXXIII [v.1] and 1871f:CXXXIII [v.2]).<br />
<strong>CXXXIV</strong> – Roman numeral not present in the manuscript because the top of the folio has crumbled off.<br />
<strong>CXXXV</strong> – Roman numeral not present in the manuscript because the top of the folio has crumbled off.<br />
<strong>CXXXVII</strong> – Roman numeral not present in the manuscript because the top of the folio has crumbled off.<br />
<strong>CXLI</strong> – Misnumbered in the manuscript as "CXL" (140).<br />
<strong>CLIX</strong> – Mistakenly written as "CLVIX" in the manuscript.<br />
<strong>CLXI</strong> – Roman numeral not present in the manuscript because the top of the folio has crumbled off.</p>

<p>In general, the individual pages of the 1871 Field Diary contain either one or more "journal" entries or one or more "notes." With a few exceptions, 1871f:CII-CXIII all contain diary entries, and Livingstone does not further describe these pages than to add the following words after the Roman numeral on 1871f:CII: "to be copied into Journal at Ujiji now."</p>

<p>It emerges that 48 of the Nyangwe Diary pages begin with a new diary entry or note. Of the 16 pages that open with a diary entry or note continued from a previous page, half include a full or abbreviated version of the word "continued" immediately after the date on the first line of the page. (The first entry of 1871l:[1] also continues from a previous page, albeit one that has not survived). On those pages where space permits, Livingstone also includes a few words of the opening diary entry on the first line of the page following the date.</p>

<p>There is no hard and fast distinction between the subject matter that might constitute a diary entry or a note. Diary entries tend to be relatively unreflective descriptions of the events and observations of a given day. Notes tend to take one of two forms: 1) reflective, at times heavily revised, drafts for letters, and 2) shorter jottings from the field such as vocabularies, descriptions of African cultural practices, and geographical information collected from informants. On occasion note-like material appears among a series of diary entries (e.g., 1871f:CII, CXII, CLX), while portions of some notes look and read like diary pages (1871f:CXXXIII [v.1], CLVII, CLXIII). Those notes with dates reinforce the argument advanced in the <a href="/spectral-imaging/manuscript-composition">Composition</a> section, namely that Livingstone did not write the pages of the 1871 Field Diary in sequential order.</p>

As relevant, copyright Dr. Neil Imray Livingstone Wilson. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported</a>.</em> These images provide examples of (top) a header diary entry with day, month, and year; (middle) a diary entry recording the day of the week; and (bottom) a diary entry beginning with a time. In addition, the latter two images show Livingstone\'s tendency to separate entries with one or two lines drawn across the page.</span></p>

<p>Diary entries typically begin in one of two ways. The first diary entry on a given page usually includes the day, month, and year. Subsequent entries begin with the day only. On the first of each month, Livingstone always gives the day, month, and day of the week, and maintains this practice throughout the 1871 Field Diary. On three occasions, Livingstone also notes the last Sunday of the month (28 Apr. 1871, 26 May 1871, 29 July 1871), and on two occasions records that a particular day is a Saturday (19 Aug. 1871, 3 Nov. 1871). In addition, Livingstone breaks down the entries for 16 July 1871, the day immediately following the Nyangwe massacre, by time of day so that there are entries for "12 AM [sic]," "1 PM," "2 PM," and "4 PM." Finally, in an apparently random manner Livingstone sometimes separates individual diary entries or notes with one to two (and, in the case of 1871f:CLIII, three) horizontal lines drawn across the page.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases, page entries run to the bottom of the page. The exceptions consist of two pages that end with an unusually large space at the bottom (1871f:CX, CXLII), one page (1871f:CXX) where Livingstone has left the bottom quarter of the page blank, and 1871f:CXXXI of the first copy-book, where Livingstone ends with a unique line of text in the lower right-hand corner of the page. The text reads: "Turn to other sheet CXXXII."</p>

<p>Although Livingstone writes with a very neat hand, the orthography of the 1871 Field Diary suggests that Livingstone’s primary concern was recording his experiences in a simple and concise manner rather than producing elaborate and refined diary entries. Long stretches of the texts contain few if any additions, deletions, or more extensive cancellations. In fact, Livingstone seems to have generally confined such editorial work to those pages designated as notes, which at times can present reading challenges because of the extensive revisions present.</p>

Such passages are the exception not the rule in the 1871 Field Diary.</span></p>

<p>For reasons of simplicity, Livingstone also limits his punctuation primarily to en-dashes (which often shade into em-dashes or even longer dashes) and equal signs (=). He distinctly prefers en-dashes, but he uses these interchangeably with equal signs in places of such punctuation as commas, colons, semicolons, and periods as well as to mark simple pauses in the text. When Livingstone uses an en-dash to introduce or follow a quotation, he places the en-dash directly below the opening or closing quotation marks rather than next to them. Curiously, the abundances of these two forms of punctuation, en-dashes and equal signs, distinguishes the 1871 Field Diary from the much more polished Unyanyembe Journal (Livingstone 1866-72). In the latter, Livingstone continues to use en-dashes and equal signs as the primary form of punctuation, but simply uses less of each.</p>

<p>Livingstone does not consistently capitalize words when he should. For instance, he often begins sentences and even diary entries with lower-case letters, and he frequently fails to capitalize proper names. Moreover, in many instances, the reading of a given letter as upper- or lower-case can be rather subjective.</p>

<p>Livingstone often, but by no means always, indents new diary entries and paragraphs. Even on the same page the amount of such indentation can vary considerably. On occasion, Livingstone also indents the opening Roman numeral on a page. Likewise, Livingstone’s spacing between words can be erratic. In general, he places the equivalent of one space between words, but as occasion demands – for instance, to avoid obtrusive printed undertext, to fit in text added above or below a line, or to write around characters hanging down from a previous line – he spaces his words farther apart.</p>

<p>Livingstone emphasizes words by underlining or, much less frequently, double-underlining them. Livingstone’s reasons for using the latter over the former are not always clear. For example, when opening one diary entry he double-underlines the superscripted "nd" in the date "2nd July 1871." Livingstone often underlines African words, but rarely does so when using words from European languages.</p>

<p>Livingstone uses both "and" and "&amp;" to connect words and phrases, but he clearly prefers "and." He consistently misspells "receive" and "conceive" as "recieve" and "concieve," respectively. He is also less than punctilious in using an apostrophe with the possessive "s." On occasion, when noting the appearance of a new moon, he draws a crescent moon rather than write out the word "moon." Finally, when breaking up a word over two lines, Livingstone sometimes places a hyphen at the end of the first line, sometimes at the beginning of the second line, sometimes in both places, and sometimes does not use a hyphen at all.</p>

<p class="space2">In addition to diary entries and notes, Livingstone’s manuscript contains five unique features: sketches, maps, calculations, extraneous foreign text, and pen flourishes to correct ink flow. The number of each of these items is limited, especially when compared to other Livingstone field diaries and notebooks.<a id="link6" name="link6"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Sketches.</strong> Livingstone includes a number of sketches on two pages of the 1871 Field Diary. The first, of a fish, appears on 1871f:CXXIII and accompanies Livingstone’s note that he "[s]aw pieces of a remarkable spotted fish with scales and tail prolonged above" (30 Apr. 1871). It appears that, prior to sending the newspaper to Livingstone, Horace Waller circled a portion of the newspaper undertext on this page that reports the arrival of a Livingstone letter (which no longer survives) in Bombay. When Livingstone turned this page 90° clockwise to write his diary entries, he inadvertently (or perhaps deliberately) drew part of his fish over the same area that Waller has circled. The result is an amalgamation of two distinct figures that, at least under multispectral light, looks distinctly like a hammer.</p>

The first two heads are in profile, the third looks straight ahead. Livingstone makes no textual reference to these sketches, but it appears that he is trying to illustrate two to three distinct local hairstyles. The last sketch on this page, which appears in the middle of the left-hand side of the page, represents a local foundry, as the accompanying text indicates: "about thirty smithies or rather foundries in the villages we passed" (2 Aug. 1871).</p>

The first, which illustrates a portion of the supposed drainage of the Lufira and Lualaba Rivers into the Kamolondo Lake, occupies the center of 1871f:CXXI.

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Calculations.</strong> Livingstone includes a variety of calculations among his diary pages, none of which have been transcribed for the current edition. In most cases, Livingstone seems to have first made the calculations on the page, then written his diary entries around them. The calculations can be divided into three general types:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Calculations of distance or time that relate to the surrounding text: 1871f:CLI, CLII</li>
	<li>Calculations of unclear purpose and indeterminate relation to the surrounding text: 1871f:CXII, CXV, CLX; 1871m:[4]</li>
	<li>Astronomical observations with indeterminate relation to the surrounding text: 1871l:[2]; 1871m:[2], [3]</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, Livingstone has covered the leaves of 1871k with a series of figures recording "Total Rainfall in Manyema 1870-71" as well as astronomical observations made at the Islet of Kasenge in Lake Tanganyika, Kasongo’s village, and Nyangwe.</p>

<p class="space2">Although Livingstone usually kept separate notebooks for astronomical observations (see Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:280), he eventually copied over the observations from 1871k into another copy-book relating to the same period (see Clendennen and Cunningham 1979:276, Field Diary 33).<a id="link9" name="link9"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Extraneous Foreign Text.</strong> The 1871 Field Diary sometimes includes foreign words and phrases among the diary entries and notes. However, on three occasions the diary pages contain extraneous foreign text that bears no obvious relation to the adjacent diary entries.</p>

<p>The first example runs perpendicular to the diary text and appears in the lower left-hand corner of 1871f:CXI. Here Livingstone has written a single line of Hebrew text (which has yet to be deciphered) as well as all the letters of the Arabic alphabet spread over three lines. In addition, Livingstone makes a second, abortive attempt to write the alphabet on a fourth line, but gets no further than the second letter.</p>

<p>The second example appears at the center of the right-hand side of 1871f:CXIV.

<p class="space2">The final examples appear on the right-hand side of 1871k:[5]. There are five lines of text here, three in Arabic and two in Nagari (the conventional script for Sanskrit as well as Hindi and Marathi). The Arabic corresponds to the English undertext on this page ("Dr David Livingstone HRM Consul Ujiji &amp; Elsewhere") and the first two lines can be translated thus: "This is to the most honorable Doctor Livingstone, consul of the Glorious [or Great] Queen, in Ujiji." The last Arabic line reads simply, "Amen." However, this is not an absolute translation. "This is to" can also be read as "the one who writes this informs," while "most honorable" can also be read as "may his glory be eternal." The Nagari has yet to be translated.<a id="link10" name="link10"></a></p>

<p><a href="#TOP" title="Go to table of contents" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">▲</a> <strong>Flourishes to Correct Ink Flow.</strong> Livingstone’s manuscript includes a series of randomly placed flourishes. The flourishes have no semantic value and appear to be Livingstone’s means of correcting the ink flow of his pen. Livingstone has drawn these flourishes on 1871f:CV, CXII; 1871m:[2], [3], [4]. Curiously, although Livingstone usually limits himself to no more than a few flourishes at one time, he has covered nearly all the available space on 1871m:[4] with them.</p>

<p><strong>Scientists.</strong> Livingstone himself was also a scientist and doctor. His writings are full of unique primary data on medicine, geology, linguistics, geography, astronomy, meteorology, and many others topics. Today such data can enhance our knowledge of issues such as erosion in Africa, wildlife conservation, climate change, and cultural dispersion. The <a href="/spectral-imaging">Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project</a> also demonstrates how modern science can be used to enhance our knowledge of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><strong>Librarians, digital humanists, and information technology specialists.</strong> <em>Livingstone Online</em> relies on an array of international standards for web access and preservation. We work with specialists from a variety of disciplines to create high quality digital data that can be sustained long into the future. Our emphasis on transparency, knowledge transfer, and documentation means that anyone can look “behind the scenes” of our project and learn, in detail, what we did, how we did it, and even how they might do it better.</p>
